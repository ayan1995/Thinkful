# Ayan Karim Challenge - Beware of Monty Hall

# In the Monty Hall problem, I would switch my door when the host reveals a door to be a dud.
# This is because the conditions of the game have changed when the host reveals a dud.
# In the begginning there's a condition that I have 3 doors to choose from. 
# I have a 1/3 chance of choosing the prize door, but when a dud is revealed, 
# I have to choose a door based on the condition that I have 2 doors and a 1/2 probability.
# Since the conditions changed, the whole game changed, and I should switch my decision
# based on the new game.

# Bayes' rule applies here because the condition of the game determines the probability of 
# winning the prize. So when a door is revealed by the host, Bayes' rule tells us that 
# since the conditions have changed, the probability of winning and the whole game has changed.
