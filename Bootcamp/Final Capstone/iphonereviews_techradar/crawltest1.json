{"text": ["<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>The Google Pixel 3 is still one of the best phones around, with not much in the way of new competition since launch. But it's still just as expensive as it was at launch too, so we've added a comparison to the cheaper OnePlus 6T.</em></p>", "<p>The Google Pixel 3 has the best smartphone camera you can buy today, and yet it comes in a one-hand-friendly size with a large enough screen to satisfy most people.</p>", "<p>You don\u2019t need a big, pocket-busting phone to get great photos (this one has a 5.5-inch screen), nor do you need a dual-lens rear camera (it has a single lens on back), nor the fastest aperture on a phone (f/1.8 has been beaten by the LG and Samsung\u2019s speedier f/1.5 aperture). Google proves that its 12.2MP photos are better because of machine-learning camera software and consistency.</p>", "<p>The Pixel 3 \u2013 and larger Pixel 3 XL \u2013 makes lugging around a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/best-compact-camera\">compact camera</a> or even an <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/best-entry-level-dslr-camera\">entry-level DSLR</a> redundant. It also has features you can't get on professional cameras, unless you're constantly changing lenses. There are two front-facing 8MP cameras here, with the second lens designed for wide-angle selfies, enabling you to get groups photos without cutting people out of the picture.</p>", "<p>To this day, the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-pixel-2-review\">Google Pixel 2</a> camera still amazes us, and the Pixel 3 builds off of that success with better photo detail and enhanced HDR. What\u2019s more, the color-rich OLED screen is far superior due to its 18:9 aspect ratio. It\u2019s not bezel-less by any means, but you do get more screen real estate than on the Pixel 2 \u2013 and keep the front-facing stereo speakers. It also avoids Pixel 3 XL\u2019s awkward notch cut out that so many people hate on.</p>", "<p>You\u2019re not going to get <em>everything</em> in this small package. The battery falls short of bigger phones at a 2,915mAh capacity, offering all-day battery life with conservative use in our tests. Snapping 100 great photos in two hours was a real battery life drain. You\u2019re also stuck with 64GB or 128GB \u2013 there\u2019s no microSD card slot, and there\u2019s no headphone jack. And, as much as we laud the behind-the-scenes camera software, the app doesn\u2019t have all of Samsung's and LG's neat camera app tricks.</p>", "<p>The Google Pixel 3 is the ideal smartphone for anyone who cares about photo quality and isn\u2019t satisfied with their phone\u2019s picture-taking abilities today. It has the camera smarts and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/android-pie-9-features-release-date-and-phones-list\"><u>Android Pie</u></a>-powered AI smarts of the Pixel 3 XL, without the awkward notch cut-out at the top. And, unlike the comparable, one-hand-friendly <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-xs-review\">iPhone XS</a>, it\u2019s cheap \u2013 at least by 2018 flagship standards.</p>", "<p><em>Watch our first impressions of the Google Pixel 3 in video form below...</em></p>", "<p>The Google Pixel 3 landed on October 18 in the US, and November 1 in the UK and Australia. Availability is also slated for Canada, France, Germany, Japan, India, Ireland, Italy, Singapore, Spain, and Taiwan. Pre-orders began right after the October 9 launch event.</p>", "<p class=\"bordeaux-image-check\"><img src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\" lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image\" onerror=\"this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" sizes=\"auto\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h4ax4uNX5fPuwLJ4wDndjd-320-80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h4ax4uNX5fPuwLJ4wDndjd-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h4ax4uNX5fPuwLJ4wDndjd-650-80.jpg 650w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h4ax4uNX5fPuwLJ4wDndjd.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h4ax4uNX5fPuwLJ4wDndjd.jpg\"></p>", "<p>The Pixel 3 price is $799 (\u00a3739, AU$1,199) for the 64GB version, and $899 (\u00a3839, AU$1,349) for the 128GB version. We recommend more internal storage since you can\u2019t upgrade later (there\u2019s no microSD card slot on this phone).</p>", "<p>On contract in the US, it's exclusive to Verizon, starting at $33.33 a month for 64GB or $37.49 a month for 128GB for the duration of 24 months. Sadly, you won't find it sold at AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Sprint, or other US carriers, but you can get the unlocked Google Pixel 3 at full price from official Google's store.</p>", "<p>It\u2019s a price hike from the Google Pixel 2 (by $150), yet cheaper than an iPhone XS (by $200). You're paying for the more expansive screen and machine-learning camera, and the fact that almost all flagship smartphones cost more in 2018.</p>", "<p class=\"mid__article\"></p>", "<p class=\"bordeaux-image-check\"><img src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\" lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image\" onerror=\"this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" sizes=\"auto\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cJ7KwbqcggTkoCUthNKkad-320-80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cJ7KwbqcggTkoCUthNKkad-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cJ7KwbqcggTkoCUthNKkad-650-80.jpg 650w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cJ7KwbqcggTkoCUthNKkad.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cJ7KwbqcggTkoCUthNKkad.jpg\"></p>", "<p>The Pixel 3 retains Google's familiar two-tone design \u2013 the back has shiny glass at the top, while lower 80% has a matte finish. There's a more seamless transition between the two textures for a higher-quality look and feel, but overall its look hasn't changed dramatically.</p>", "<p>It easily fits in one hand, and, for the most part, you can operate it without resorting to using two hands. That's the best reason to choose the Pixel 3 over the Pixel 3 XL. It's screen size is big enough, yet the phone handfeel is rather manageable. That and it doesn't have an ugly notch cut out at the top, a design choice that a deal breaker for many.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The Pixel 3 series looks similar to last year's phones, but it does in fact use different materials. The entire back is made of soft-touch glass using Corning Gorilla Glass 5. It's the same strengthened glass that protects the front screen, and it's all sandwiching an aluminum frame that has a hybrid coating \u2013 that's the only bit of metal you'll find on the outside.</p>", "<p class=\"bordeaux-image-check\"><img src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\" lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image\" onerror=\"this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" sizes=\"auto\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5bvi4a2qPYyrN6iM4n9JmW-320-80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5bvi4a2qPYyrN6iM4n9JmW-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5bvi4a2qPYyrN6iM4n9JmW-650-80.jpg 650w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5bvi4a2qPYyrN6iM4n9JmW.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5bvi4a2qPYyrN6iM4n9JmW.jpg\"></p>", "<p>Sure, the all-glass design makes the Pixel 3 more susceptible to damage (though we have yet to find the scratches others have reported), but glass also enables a better LTE connection and wireless charging. That's why we've seen a lack of aluminum-backed flagship phones in 2018. The Pixel 3 is the latest causality.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Wireless charging is a new feature for the Pixel phones, and a welcome change now that Google has launched the Pixel Stand wireless charger alongside its new devices. We haven't had a wirelessly charging Google phone since the plastic <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/google-nexus-6-1271190/review\">Nexus 6</a>.</p>", "<p>More rounded edges are everywhere on the Pixel 3. Its frame is less boxy than previous Google phones, a trend we've seen from the iPhone and and others. Gone is the harsher silver bevel around the frame and rear fingerprint sensor. It's like Google put the Pixel 2 through a smoothing machine, and we like the results.</p>", "<p>You'll still find dual front-facing speakers on the Google Pixel 3. No one else is really doing this anymore (except Razer with the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/hands-on-razer-phone-2\">Razer Phone 2</a>), so it's nice to see in a flagship device. You'll also get Active Edge, which allows you to squeeze the sides of the phone to call up Google Assistant. We much prefer this squeeze mechanic as opposed to a dedicated AI button on the frame, like Samsung does with Bixby button (which we often confuse for the volume down button).</p>", "<p>The Pixel 3 comes with USB-C earbuds in the box, which means, no, there's no standard 3.5mm headphone jack (just like last year's Pixel 2) and without that microSD card slot, you're stuck with 64GB and 128GB storage configurations.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The Pixel 3 color are rather muted, with 'Just Black' as our favorite of the trio. 'Clearly White' looks cheaper and 'Not Pink' isn't for everyone. Okay, it's the color you want if you're looking to stand out a bit, but we liked last year's unique Mint color more. You do get a fresh Mint color on the Clearly White Google Pixel 3 power button, however.</p>", "<p>The 5.5-inch OLED screen fits into modern times. It's big and expansive, and sits in a phone that's smaller than we had expected given the screen size rumors. The entire thing measures 145.6 x 68.2 x 7.9mm and weighs 148g. It's roughly the same size as the Pixel 2, which had a smaller 5-inch display.</p>", "<p>It's the grown up version of last year's phone. The Pixel 3 screen looks richer than last year's Pixel 2, too. The specs note that it has only a few more pixels per inch, but keep in mind the screen is much taller, so there are a lot more pixels spread across a half inch of extra screen. There's noticeably less bezel thanks to it's 18:9 aspect ratio rather than the dated 16:9 look. Last year's oversized bezel, we felt, was the biggest disappointment design-wise about the Pixel 2XL. The Google Pixel 3 fixes this issue.</p>", "<p>Oh, it still has bezel. There's no hiding the two front-facing cameras and speaker at the top and chin at the bottom. But it's the best we've seen from a phone with dual front-facing speakers and without a deep (some would say ugly) notch cut out.</p>"]},

{"text": ["<p>The Google Pixel 3 has the best smartphone camera in the world. It's not because the photos it takes are dramatically better \u2014 but they're just marginally better.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The bigger deal is that Google's 12.2MP camera is more consistent. We got more detailed, sharper, and slightly brighter photos from this Pixel 3 camera than the warmer iPhone XS and the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 cameras. There's less noise than the Pixel 2 and everything wasn't over-sharpened like the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/huawei-p20-pro-review\">Huawei P20 Pro</a> camera.</p>", "<p class=\"bordeaux-image-check\"><img src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\" lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image\" onerror=\"this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" sizes=\"auto\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KC3b5wyzm6PQQqVZypNBZd-320-80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KC3b5wyzm6PQQqVZypNBZd-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KC3b5wyzm6PQQqVZypNBZd-650-80.jpg 650w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KC3b5wyzm6PQQqVZypNBZd.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KC3b5wyzm6PQQqVZypNBZd.jpg\"></p>", "<p>A lot of this has to do with what's happening behind the scenes. The f/1.8 aperture isn't record-breaking, but Google's camera-dedicated Pixel Visual Core chip and its machine-learning software help deliver this single-lens rear camera its wow factor.</p>", "<p class=\"mid__article\"></p>", "<p>New software perks like Top Shot help avoid closed eyes by picking the right photo, while Night Sight (coming soon) will give the Google Pixel 3 the edge in most nighttime pictures. It's already doing a fine job (for a smartphone camera) in low-light, according to our tests.</p>", "<p>Super Res Zoom helps mitigate the fact that there's no telephoto lens here, with the ability to use backend software to improve digitally zoom The fact that the camera captures larger 1.4 micron pixels and has optical image stabilization (OIS) is also a difference maker.</p>", "<p>The same general photo consistency comes to the front-facing 8MP cameras. They reliably took photos with better HDR and less noise. One camera had a normal 75 degree field of view and the other has a wider 97 degree field of view.</p>", "<p>The wide-angle selfies are effective at telling more about who you're with and what you're posing in front of, so much so that Google refers to this secondary lens as it's Group Selfie Camera.</p>", "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/lg-v10-1305854/review\"><u>LG V10</u></a> introduced us to this wide selfie camera idea, and the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lg-v40-thinq\"><u>LG V40</u></a> continues the trend. Google\u2019s wide-angle photos are better, though they do have some caveats.\u00a0The aperture is f/2.2 using this lens (vs f1.8 on the normal lens) but you won't notice a big difference in good lighting. The bigger caveat to the Group Selfie Camera is barrel distortion around the edges.</p>", "<p>Holding the phone just right helps capture more of what's around you, whether you're posing in front of a tall building or taking a crowded selfie. We posed in front of a distant Hollywood sign, and got an LA-emblazoned T-Shirt in the photo. With any normal selfie camera, the T-Shirt or the Hollywood sign would be cut out.</p>", "<p>Here's the problem: Holding in the wrong way takes unflattering photos that make you look like you've been through a funhouse mirror. You may be able to capture more of what's above you, but when more of your shirt fans out, you look like you've put on some awkward weight. Holding the phone out further or at a different angle usually helps. Taking selfies is a skill. Taking wide selfies will earn you another millennial merit badge.</p>", "<p>The Pixel 3 shoots impressive 4K video with a mix of optical image stabilization (OIS) and electronic software stabilization. Everything looks incredibly smooth, making the need for something like the DJI Osmo 2 gimbal less of a necessity. You won't, however, find the 4K to shoot 60 frames per second. Google has capped video at this max resolution at 30fps.</p>"]},

Yes, you can get all-day battery life from this phone with conservative use, but even normal use had us reaching for the charger before the end of the night.

The new glass back gives this feature the ability to charge with any Qi charger.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Google launched its minimalist-looking Pixel Stand wireless charger, which doubles as a way to see notifications and interact with Google Assistant, as if this were a mini Google Home Hub.The stand isn't ideal for traveling (it doesn't fold flat, sadly), but it's a nice option for slightly slower 10W charging on a night stand. We were able to reach 80% battery capacity in 1 hour and 39 minutes using wireless charging.</p>"]},

Tapping the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-xs-review\">iPhone XS</a>-like bottom home button bar (no longer a big circular button) sends you home, while swiping up on this flat bar opens the new recent menu to switch between apps. Swiping up further reveals the app drawer. The back button still works as normal, but is smaller than before.</p>", "<p>All of this is in an effort to give the Google Pixel 3 extra screen real estate. It\u2019s effective and you\u2019ll get used to the changes, even if it\u2019s painstaking at first. Your muscle memory needs time to adjust.</p>", "<p>The trade-off is worth it, though it\u2019s not Earth-shattering. The same goes for the time and the notification icons along the top, as the Android software is now fit for notched displays (even if this phone doesn\u2019t have a screen cut out at the top).</p>", "<p>The right-aligned volume slider interface (right next to the physical volume slider) makes it easier to wrap your head around whether you're adjusting call volume or media volume. Essentially, the slider is now dedicated to media, with a smaller on-screen button to toggle vibrate/ringer/silent. We\u2019ve also had less issues with misguided screen rotation thanks to the new software. That's such a small, but meaningful change for everyday use.</p>", "<p>Behind-the-scenes tools are even more groundbreaking. Adaptive battery life and adaptive brightness settings free you from having to worry about closing apps to save battery life and adjusting the brightness in different surroundings. Google\u2019s machine-learning software does the heavy lifting by learning your behaviors and taking into account your environment.</p>", "<p>We haven\u2019t seen App Slices and App Actions from the operating system, but they\u2019re shortcuts coming soon so that you can access apps (and content within those apps) faster.

{"text": ["<p>The Google Pixel 3 is offering a lot, and in a tighter package than most other flagship phones \u2013 the larger Pixel 3 XL included. Chief among them is the single-lens 12.2MP rear camera that delivers slightly better photos and, even more importantly, consistently usable photos compared to the competition. Samsung and LG camera phones occasionally exhibited blurriness or poor low-light performance, and Apple\u2019s iPhone XS Max liked to using warmer than necessary color tones.
