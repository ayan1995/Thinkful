            "<p>It seems Google has a real problem with secrets, because after a <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/this-could-be-the-cheap-pixel-3-people-were-hoping-for-1830501985\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/this-could-be-the-cheap-pixel-3-people-were-hoping-for-1830501985', {metric25:1})\">Russian blog shared info about the upcoming Pixel 3 Lite</a> late last year, now there\u2019s a complete review of what appears to be a pre-production <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwaT4u-1Y60&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwaT4u-1Y60&amp;feature=youtu.be', {metric25:1})\">Pixel 3 Lite on YouTube</a>. </p>",
            "<p>In accordance with previous leaks, Andro News claims the Pixel 3 Lite shown off in the video goes by the code name \u201cSargo.\u201d The device seemingly confirms a few details from previous reports, such as its plastic body, Snapdragon 670 processor, and 5.5-inch screen. </p>",
            "<p class=\"has-video media-large video-embed align--bleed\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-chomp-id=\"pwaT4u-1Y60\" scrolling=\"no\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" data-src=\"/ajax/inset/iframe?id=youtube-video-pwaT4u-1Y60&amp;start=0\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://pwaT4u-1Y60\" height=\"450\" id=\"youtube-pwaT4u-1Y60\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitAllowFullScreen\" class=\"core-inset lazyload\" width=\"800\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span></p>",
            "<p>However, there are some notable changes and tidbits of new info about the Pixel 3 Lite in this video, including a possible release window.  Andro News says be Pixel 3 Lite will be available around Google I/O 2019, which typically takes place in May. Additionally, this apparent Pixel 3 Lite also sports a headphone jack, which is something <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/this-could-be-the-cheap-pixel-3-people-were-hoping-for-1830501985#_ga=2.137127922.316976217.1547477548-1220318864.1537376527\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/this-could-be-the-cheap-pixel-3-people-were-hoping-for-1830501985#_ga=2.137127922.316976217.1547477548-1220318864.1537376527', {metric25:1})\">Rozetked</a> claimed the phone didn\u2019t have in its leak from 2018. </p>",
            "<p>Other differences between this device and the standard Pixel 3 include bottom-mounted speakers instead of front-facing stereo speakers on the Pixel 3, slightly larger bezels, and what appears to be a new pale blue color option. Also, unlike the Pixel 3, the device  only comes with 32GB of base storage, which feels a bit skimpy for new phone in 2019. However, as a mid-range phone and with the support of Google\u2019s various cloud storage options, the Pixel 3 Lite\u2019s somewhat limited storage wouldn\u2019t be a deal breaker. </p>",
            "<p>According to Andro News, the real exciting part about the Pixel 3 Lite is its picture taking abilities. That\u2019s because while the Pixel 3 Lite  only features a single 12-MP rear camera, it apparently comes with a new autofocus sensor and  image quality similar to the standard Pixel 3. That\u2019s a pretty big claim, but since much of the Pixel 3's photo magic lies in software, it\u2019s not an entirely unbelievable.</p>",
            "<p>Based on the Russian language setting seen on this early Pixel 3 Lite, it\u2019s possible that Andro News\u2019 and Rozetked could share the same source when it comes to obtaining prototype units. However the new color scheme and headphone jack in this leak suggest that Andro News may have obtained a slightly more up-to-date sample.<br></p>",
            "<p>Either way, if the Pixel 3 Lite ends up being similar to what\u2019s been shown off in leaks so far, we could be looking at a really solid mid-range phone and possibly the true spiritual successor to the now defunct Nexus phone line. The only major detail we don\u2019t have much info on yet is price, however, if past history is any indication, I expect we\u2019ll get more clues as we get closer to Google I/O in May. </p>",

            "<p>As good as the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/google-pixel-3-review-the-other-way-to-make-a-killer-p-1829749807\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/google-pixel-3-review-the-other-way-to-make-a-killer-p-1829749807', {metric25:1})\">Pixel 3</a> is, when Google released the phone last month, it sort of felt incomplete. Part of that feeling is due to Google\u2019s software-first approach to smartphone design which means there\u2019s always code being tinkered with, but the other part was simply because Google still hadn\u2019t delivered two major Pixel 3 features the company teased prior to launch.<br></p>",
            "<p>But starting today, one of those missing additions, <a href=\"http://www.blog.google/products/pixel/see-light-night-sight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://www.blog.google/products/pixel/see-light-night-sight/', {metric25:1})\">Night Sight</a>, is finally rolling out to Pixel 3 owners, and after having the chance to test it out for a few days, I can safely say Google\u2019s sophisticated camera feature was worth the wait.</p>",
            "<p>Previously, when faced with certain low-light situations, the Pixel 3 sometimes struggled to best phones with larger aperture lenses like the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-note-9-is-the-best-big-phone-1828348138\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-note-9-is-the-best-big-phone-1828348138', {metric25:1})\">Galaxy Note 9</a>, or top sophisticated low-light techniques like Huawei\u2019s impressive Night Mode, which really pushed the use of HDR photo processing when it debuted earlier this year on the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-triple-camera-p20-pro-is-too-cool-for-america-1825647834\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-triple-camera-p20-pro-is-too-cool-for-america-1825647834', {metric25:1})\">P20 Pro</a>.</p>",
            "<p>However, Night Sight changes all that, and thanks to Google flexing its computational photography skills, the Pixel 3 is now capable of capturing some incredible low-light pics. And to prove it, I took all the best smartphone cameras out for a side-by-side nighttime shootout.</p>",
            "<p>One quick note before we get to the pictures. Accessing Night Sight is as easy as scrolling over to the More tab in Google\u2019s camera app and then tapping the icon for Night Sight. But when you actually shoot a picture, it\u2019s not a simple click and you\u2019re done. Similar to Huawei\u2019s Night Mode, Night Sight shoots multiple images during a three to four-second window, and then combines those images together to create a final pic that looks better than each original frame on its own. That means to get the best results, you really need to try to hold your phone as steady as possible.</p>",
            "<p>OK, now onto the photos. To set a baseline, I started by taking two shots with the Pixel 3, one with Night Sight off and one with Night Sight on. And while in some respects, I like the pic taken without Night Sight more because its richer colors and darker exposure make for a moodier final image, when it comes to details and sharpness, the photo taken with Night Sight is clearly superior. Text on signs is clearer, the overall image is much less grainy, and you can even make out each individual brick in the building no matter where you\u2019re looking.</p>",
            "<p>Next, I moved on to a face-off between the Pixel 3 and the Galaxy Note 9; a battle of computer smarts versus a wider f/1.5 lens aided by a touch of AI tuning. This time at a local bar, while both photos look pretty good zoomed out, you can still see things like the overly yellow color cast often produced by Samsung cameras in low light.</p>",
            "<p>But when you start pixel peeping at 100 percent, you can really appreciate little details from the general sharpness on every sign and sticker to the Pixel 3's ability to clearly capture the wood grain on the framed chalkboard and the texture on various beer taps.</p>",
            "<p>For the Pixel 3's third challenge, I shot a nighttime cityscape with it and Huawei\u2019s new Mate 20 Pro. And once again, while the Pixel 3's pic does show some signs of over-sharpening like the hard pink outline on the lights at the top of the building in the middle, Night Sight still bested Huawei\u2019s Night Mode, which up till now, was the best way to capture challenging low-light scenes.</p>",
            "<p>Also, while I was up there, I decided to see if Night Sight could work in combination with Google\u2019s Super Res Zoom feature, and it seems it does. But the bigger shock is that for a camera with a supposed 3x zoom, the Mate 20 Pro\u2019s Night Mode pic was a blurry mess compared to the Pixel 3's image. Now part of this may have been due to having to hand hold both phones, which is far from ideal, but both pics were shot one after another under the exact same circumstances, and I\u2019m still struggling to work out why things turned out so poorly for the Mate 20 Pro. </p>",
            "<p>Finally, in what may have been the most difficult challenge, I took a shot using the Pixel 3 and an iPhone XS of a pizza lit almost solely by a single candle. And the difference couldn\u2019t be more apparent. The colors in the Pixel 3's pic are brighter, it features better contrast, and despite a fair amount of noise in the dark background, everything else is just so much clearer. Suffice to say, if you take a lot of pics in dimly lit restaurants, the Pixel 3 and Night Sight is probably your ticket to way better food photography.</p>",
            "<p>Night Sight is exactly what the Pixel 3 needed to really round out its photo toolkit. But in strange way, the biggest winners of all this may be Pixel 1 and Pixel 2 owners, who will also be getting Night Sight over the next few days. Night Sight is available as an update the Pixel 3's camera app via a Play Store update starting today.<br></p>"

            "<p>If you just look at the Pixel 3's specs, its price doesn\u2019t make any sense. Sure, you get a Snapdragon 845 processor, which is the same chip found in every other flagship Android phone. But both the standard $700 Pixel and the $750 Pixel 3 XL\u2014which have already been discounted $100 to $250 in the three months since its launch\u2014only get 4GB of RAM.</p>",
            "<p>Compared to Samsung, while the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944', {metric25:1})\">Galaxy S9</a> also has 4GB of memory, the S9+ gets 6GBs. But it\u2019s OnePlus that really makes the Pixel 3's price look ridiculous by offering a config of <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/oneplus-6t-review-the-no-bullshit-best-deal-in-smartph-1830066240\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/oneplus-6t-review-the-no-bullshit-best-deal-in-smartph-1830066240', {metric25:1})\">the OP6T</a> with 8GB of RAM and 128GB GBs of storage (both double what you get on a Pixel 3) for just $580. That\u2019s an extra 64GB of room for stashing pictures, apps, videos, and anything else you save on your phone, while that extra RAM lets you keep multiple apps (games especially) suspended in the background, so you aren\u2019t constantly forced to reload them into memory.</p>",
            "<p>What happened to the ethos of old Nexus phones that paired stock Android to well-built devices with reasonable price tags? With the cost of flagship phones hitting new highs every year, a really good $500 phone has never been more important, and yet, it\u2019s a sector that so many companies are just ceding to OnePlus and other Chinese phone makers.</p>",
            "<p>Then there\u2019s the Pixel 3's\u00a05.5-inch 2160 x 1080 OLED screen. Compared to the 5.8-inch 2960 x 1440 display on the Galaxy S9, Samsung\u2019s screen not only offers a higher pixel density, but it\u2019s brighter and more vibrant as well. On top of that, like the iPhone, the Pixel 3 doesn\u2019t have expandable storage or a headphone jack. So what are you paying for? Some black paint inside the USB-C port, wireless charging (a feature that should have been on last year\u2019s Pixel 2), and a fancy soft-touch micro-etched glass back? The math just doesn\u2019t add up.</p>",
            "<p>But what\u2019s annoying is that as amazing as Google\u2019s computational photography and HDR+ mode are, the Pixel 3 could be an even better picture taker if Google truly embraced the dual camera trend. It\u2019s maddening because Google\u2019s use of dual front-facing cams on the Pixel 3 for capturing super wide angle selfies demonstrates that the company is aware of the potential benefits of multiple cameras. And yet, on the back of the Pixel 3, one cam is all you get.</p>",
            "<p>Not even the larger Pixel 3 XL sports two, despite literally every other similarly-sized flagship phone this year featuring dual rear cams (or more in the case of the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-20-pro-is-a-technical-marvel-1830346004#_ga=2.240022085.73363231.1545052280-2135808592.1525885870\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-20-pro-is-a-technical-marvel-1830346004#_ga=2.240022085.73363231.1545052280-2135808592.1525885870', {metric25:1})\">Mate 20 Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/lgs-5-camera-phone-offers-a-snapshot-of-the-incredible-1829488124\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/lgs-5-camera-phone-offers-a-snapshot-of-the-incredible-1829488124', {metric25:1})\">LG V40</a>, and others). Just think how good the Pixel 3's long-distance photos could be if Google implemented Super Res Zoom on a camera with an optical 2x zoom lens. Or imagine how much better the Pixel 3's portrait mode would look if Google combined the extra depth info you\u2019d get from a second image sensor with the sophisticated <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/learning-to-predict-depth-on-pixel-3.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/learning-to-predict-depth-on-pixel-3.html', {metric25:1})\">learned depth</a> the Pixel 3 uses already.</p>",
            "<p>Then there\u2019s the Pixel 3 XL\u2019s big bathtub of a notch. Normally, I don\u2019t care about notches\u2014they are <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/after-just-6-months-the-phone-notch-is-already-deeply-1823469447\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/after-just-6-months-the-phone-notch-is-already-deeply-1823469447', {metric25:1})\">simply an interim method for creating extra screen real estate while we wait for full bezel-less devices</a>. But the Pixel 3 XL\u2019s notch is absolutely massive. It\u2019s nearly two full rows of notifications tall, and even with that big bucktooth hanging down, the Pixel 3 XL still has an unusually large chin. WTF. You can have a notch <em>or</em> a chin, not both.</p>",
            "<p>All these inscrutable hardware decisions sort of hit on one overarching theme: That Google doesn\u2019t really give a shit about hardware, at least not in the same way other gadget makers do. For a flagship, it feels like Google did the bare minimum needed to assemble the Pixel 3, and then relied on its software prowess to carry the phone the rest of the way. It\u2019s not just the Pixel 3, just look across Google\u2019s entire range of products, and in most cases, the company goes out of its way to avoid talking about specs or components.</p>",
            "<p>Instead, Google focuses on things like designs with bright, friendly colors and textured fabrics that fit in with modern living. It feels like Google hopes its devices will appear simple and innocuous like a light switch on a wall, which makes sense from an ease-of-use standpoint and for devices like the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/its-hard-not-to-love-the-google-home-mini-1819341054\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/its-hard-not-to-love-the-google-home-mini-1819341054', {metric25:1})\">Home Mini.</a> But if Google is really going to challenge Apple and Samsung, it needs to care more about hardware too.</p>",
            "<p>As for the Pixel 3's software, the company is doing amazing things to help combat robocalls with its built-in Call Screener, and streamline your life by letting the Google Assistant book your appointments. But at the same time, if Google is going to continue with its software-first approach to phone development, it needs to do a better job of crushing bugs.

            "<p>Nothing ruins a new smartphone more than critical features like messaging or the camera not working, and as a reviewer, it\u2019s frustrating to see people suffer from issues you didn\u2019t experience while testing, especially when the only advice you can give is to say that \u201cGoogle is working on patching the issue soon.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s a similar issue for features like <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2018/11/28/comment-google-pixel-launch-buy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://9to5google.com/2018/11/28/comment-google-pixel-launch-buy/', {metric25:1})\">Night Sight</a> and <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/i-broke-google-duplex-but-its-still-impressive-1827131546\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/i-broke-google-duplex-but-its-still-impressive-1827131546', {metric25:1})\">Google Duplex</a>, because as good as they are, if you tease them at your launch event, they probably ought to be available when the phone first goes on sale. Is DLC something we need to worry about on phones now too?</p>",
            "<p>There are also other notable concerns like Google\u2019s ramshackle quality control. For the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/google-is-investigating-an-issue-with-the-pixel-2-xl-s-1819765192\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/google-is-investigating-an-issue-with-the-pixel-2-xl-s-1819765192', {metric25:1})\">second year in a row</a>, Gizmodo got review devices featuring screens with markedly different color temperatures. And when I asked for comment on the issue, Google said some variances in manufacturing sometimes results in minor difference. But the thing is, iPhones and Galaxys don\u2019t suffer from these kinds of issues, the Pixel shouldn\u2019t either.</p>",
            "<p>Ben Schoon over at 9to5Google recently made a case that between all of the bugs and issues new Pixel owners tend to experience at launch\u2014and all the price reductions that follow shortly after\u2014<a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2018/11/28/comment-google-pixel-launch-buy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://9to5google.com/2018/11/28/comment-google-pixel-launch-buy/', {metric25:1})\">that no one should buy a Pixel at launch ever again</a>. And while I won\u2019t go that far (Google has one more chance to get it right), early Pixel adopters do seem to be treated more like beta testers more than buyers of any other phone.</p>",
            "<p>And when it comes to the way Google collects data from your phone, there\u2019s unrest brewing. On the one hand, a lot of very handy features like traffic alerts for your daily commute, restaurants suggestions, and f<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/googles-feature-for-predicting-flight-delays-actually-s-1831148930\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/googles-feature-for-predicting-flight-delays-actually-s-1831148930', {metric25:1})\">light delay predictions</a> are things that can only work if Google knows some pretty intimate details about you. But at the same time, concerns about privacy and data security are becoming more prevalent, and issues like <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.apnews.com/828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb', {metric25:1})\">Android tracking</a> you even when you specifically turn the feature off isn\u2019t helping anyone feel better about our new super-connected world.</p>",
            "<p>Lastly, Google\u2019s partnership with Verizon as the \u201cexclusive\u201d retailer of the Pixel is bullshit. Yes, you can buy an unlocked Pixel 3 direct from Google and take it to pretty much any carrier you want, but if Google wants to compete with Apple and Samsung, the Pixel needs to be available in every carrier store, regardless of what name is on the sign outside.</p>",
            "<p>I still believe the Pixel 3 is the best phone for most people. But the gap between the Pixel 3 and other phones isn\u2019t nearly as wide as it could have been. And after three years, while Google was finally able to put all the pieces together properly in creating the Pixel 3, until Google can offer the kind of quality control, stability, and value you get from iPhones and Galaxys, the Pixel may be forced to live in their shadows.</p>",

        "author": "Sam Rutherford",
        "text": [
            "<p>In a world of increasingly complex tech, wireless chargers are refreshingly simple devices. Just take your phone, drop it on a pad or stand, and walk away. That\u2019s it. And now that wireless charging is basically a standard feature for most flagship handsets, it\u2019s quickly becoming the preferred way to keep your phone\u2019s battery topped up. But what if your wireless charger could do more than just excite electrons without the need for wires or cables? Well, that\u2019s exactly what Google is trying to do with the new <a href=\"https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_stand?hl=en-US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_stand?hl=en-US', {metric25:1})\">Pixel Stand</a>.<br></p>",
            "<p>To start, Google took a 10-watt wireless charging stand (<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/we-tested-5-wireless-chargers-for-the-iphone-and-this-i-1821575429\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/we-tested-5-wireless-chargers-for-the-iphone-and-this-i-1821575429', {metric25:1})\">which is a bit faster than most wireless chargers</a>) and then it did what Google does best: programmed in a bunch of neat software tricks. And the result? When docked, the Pixel Stand transforms a Pixel 3 into a mini smart speaker plus <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/googles-home-hub-is-a-great-start-to-a-smarter-home-1829844478#_ga=2.2570425.80129596.1540211252-2135808592.1525885870\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/googles-home-hub-is-a-great-start-to-a-smarter-home-1829844478#_ga=2.2570425.80129596.1540211252-2135808592.1525885870', {metric25:1})\">Home Hub</a>, with the potential to be even more in the future.</p>",
            "<p>Unlike like other wireless chargers, the Pixel Stand is smart (or at least smarter), so not only does it know where it is, it can also differentiate between different Pixel phones. There isn\u2019t even a need to download the Pixel Stand app, as it should be pre-installed on all Pixel 3s. From there, you can name your stand before wading through its settings to best customize its functions for your needs</p>",
            "<p>If you\u2019re someone who likes to keep a wireless charger next to the bed next to your bed, you can set it to automatically turn on Do Not Disturb mode so your phone won\u2019t blink or vibrate when you\u2019re trying to sleep. In fact, if you want to be even more specific, you can set the Pixel Stand to only turn on Do Not Disturb between set times, so that you can still see notifications during the day, and still get uninterrupted silence at night. And if you happen to have two Pixel Stands, say one at home and one at work, you can customize them individually to best suit their location.</p>",
            "<p>On top of the Pixel Stand\u2019s charging and notification duties, Google also created custom music and photo interfaces, so that when a Pixel 3 is sitting on the stand, you can easily view things like album art and song titles at a glance, with big buttons along the bottom so you can pause and skip between tracks without needing to unlock the phone. Now, when you take into account the Pixel 3's powerful front-facing stereo speakers and the Pixel Stand\u2019s bespoke music interface, suddenly everything begins to make sense. These products were designed in tandem, and when combined, a Pixel 3 essentially becomes Google Home Mini, except that unlike a Home Mini, it\u2019s much easier to take your phone with you when you leave the room.</p>",
            "<p>As for pictures, the device\u2019s dedicated gallery mode syncs with Google Photos and displays them on the Pixel 3's screen. You can set it to only pull images from specific albums (in case you\u2019re worried about privacy) and it will even vary between single shots and a tw0-shot layout that makes the best of the phone\u2019s real estate. So now, the Pixel Stand turns your phone into a mini digital picture frame too. But we\u2019re not done yet.</p>",
            "<p>And for folks who have trouble getting up in the morning, the Pixel Stand also features what Google calls a Sunrise Alarm. The way it works is that based on whatever alarms you have set, 15 minutes before any noises go off, the Pixel 3's screen turns on and gradually shifts from orange to yellow in an attempt to wake you up more gently.</p>",
            "<p>However, because the Sunrise Alarm is reliant on the Pixel 3's screen for illumination, it doesn\u2019t get quite as bright as a dedicated wake-up light. But if you prefer to sleep in pitch black light me, the extra yellow light is still quite noticeable. And if light alone isn\u2019t enough to rouse you, when your alarm finally goes off, the Pixel Stand\u2019s alarm screen also includes Snooze and Dismiss buttons so you can continue on (or not) with the rest of your day.</p>",
            "<p>Also, like everything else Google makes these days, the Pixel Stand also features Google Assistant integration. That means you can start your day by getting a quick rundown or your schedule and a weather forecast, control lights or other smart devices, or just ask it any other questions you might have.</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel Stand even has tie-ins with security gadgets like Nest\u2019s Video Doorbell, so that anytime the camera senses motion, it will automatically send the video feed straight to your phone, assuming it\u2019s sitting on a Pixel Stand. Sadly, this function is currently restricted to Google\u2019s family of Nest devices, and while I did have a chance to see this in action during the Pixel 3 launch event, I don\u2019t own any Nest products myself, so I haven\u2019t been able to actually test it out. Hopefully, Google can partner up with more companies down the road so that this sort of functionality is available across a wider range of devices.</p>",
            "<p>Now as good as all this sounds, there are a few issues with the Pixel Stand. The most obvious of these is that none of these features work with non-Pixel phones, which is a real shame because many of the features are rooted in software, one might think it would be Google\u2019s interest to make them available to the wider Android community. The other major problem is that while the Pixel Stand charges phones just fine in portrait or landscape mode, Google\u2019s custom music screen only really works when the phone is resting vertically.</p>",
            "<p>I also had a few issues getting the Sunrise Alarm to work properly alongside Ambient Photo Mode, as the latter tended to override the alarm\u2019s glowing wake up screen. And while the Pixel Stand boasts some relatively speedy charging speeds, priced at $80, it ain\u2019t cheap either.</p>",
            "<p>Out of all this though, there\u2019s one thing that feels truly shady. Thanks to its 10-watt wireless charging capabilities, the Pixel Stand topped off a Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL faster than other similarly priced chargers. That\u2019s good, right? Well not really, because as part of its charging protocol, Google requires the Pixel 3 to establish a <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/22/google-limits-pixel-3-wireless-charging-rate-standard-5w-third-party-charging-pads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/22/google-limits-pixel-3-wireless-charging-rate-standard-5w-third-party-charging-pads/', {metric25:1})\">\u201csecure handshake\u201d</a> in order to get full 10-watt wireless charging. All non-Google-certified wireless stands are restricted to just 5-watt charging (even though the phone will say it\u2019s \u201ccharging rapidly), regardless of their actual capabilities.</p>",
            "<p>This approach is a new spin on the walled ecosystems that Apple, Microsoft, and more recently, Google have built, and it doesn\u2019t feel good. I\u2019m sure part of the reasoning here is about protecting the device, but given all the smart capabilities of this stand, it seems like it should also be smart enough to detect how much juice is flowing in and regulate things appropriately, without the need to hamstring chargers made by other companies. Samsung and Apple don\u2019t do this on their phones, and I wish Google wouldn\u2019t either.</p>",
            "<p>But when compared to its less sophisticated brethren, the Pixel Stand serves as a reminder that wireless chargers can do more than just fill up your battery. And for anyone dead set on buying a new Pixel 3, I\u2019d argue that a Pixel Stand is almost a required accessory, even if part of the reason for that is because Google refuses to play nice with others. It\u2019s one part smart speaker, one part picture frame, and maybe someday, it will even be a portal into your home security. For $80, not only is the Pixel Stand an above average wireless charger, it makes an already intelligent phone just that much smarter.</p>",
            "<p><strong>[Update: 10/25 at 5:00 pm]</strong> We have updated the review to reflect that you can change the Pixel Stand\u2019s settings even when your phone isn\u2019t docked by going to Connected Devices &gt; Previously Connected Devices. Also, for retail Pixel 3 devices, there shouldn\u2019t be a need to download the Pixel Stand app, as the app should come pre-installed.</p>"

Making things somewhat more confusing, Android Police noted that the Pixel 3 still displays a message saying \u201ccharging rapidly\u201d when it\u2019s connected to a third-party device charging at the lesser speed.</p>",

            "<p>Finally, the Verge reported that Google confirmed the Pixel Stand does support other Qi-compatible devices, but only does so at the slower 5 watt rate. So a Pixel Stand is not going to charge rivals\u2019 phones at the full speed, either.</p>",
            "<p>In a statement to the Verge, Google denied imposing any restrictions on third-party devices and said more options would be coming soon:</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel Stand costs a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/drm-for-chargers-google-pixel-3-locks-fast-qi-charging-to-its-own-79-stand/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/drm-for-chargers-google-pixel-3-locks-fast-qi-charging-to-its-own-79-stand/', {metric25:1})\">whopping $79</a>, and though it comes <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/how-to/pixel-stand-5-things-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.cnet.com/how-to/pixel-stand-5-things-to-know/', {metric25:1})\">with other features</a> including Google Assistant and serving as a digital photo frame, that\u2019s a massive premium over other third-party chargers which can cost as little as $15. The Belkin charger in question, which appeared to be the only other approved accessory listed yet, has a price of $59.99. Conversely, competitors\u2019 devices largely support fast-charging speeds higher than 5 watts with broad cross-compatibility for chargers.</p>",
            "<p>Ars Technica compared the move to DRM, noting consumers will almost certainly not be pleased to discover they have to dig through their wallet to purchase an approved device:<br></p>",

            "<p>While we found photos taken with the Pixel 3 to be mighty appealing, we have also been fortunate enough to not run into a bug that has <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/9pbk6z/google_still_hasnt_fixed_the_issue_of_photos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/9pbk6z/google_still_hasnt_fixed_the_issue_of_photos/', {metric25:1})\">left many rumblings on social media</a>. Periodically, photos taken with the phone simply won\u2019t save for some users.</p>",
            "<p>The issue appears to occur when the Pixel 3's camera app shuts down immediately after a photo is taken\u2014not having time to save the photo before closing. This could be due to a shortage of RAM. The Pixel 3 has just 4GB of RAM, while many other flagship (re: $800) Android phones have 6GB or more. <br></p>",
            "<p>In Android, applications shutting down suddenly is a common indication of a RAM shortage or a failure of the phone\u2019s OS to manage memory appropriately, which is why many other Android phones have run into the issue, including all the earlier Pixels, the Nexus 5x, and a wide variety of budget devices.</p>",
            "<p>According to Android Police, Google says a fix will be rolled out to the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, as well as earlier Pixel devices, which also appear to have been affected (though without a similar online furor). It is not clear if this fix will affect all Android devices, or just the Pixel line\u2014we\u2019ve reached out to Google for clarification.</p>",
            "<p>\u201cWe will be rolling out a software update in the coming weeks to address the rare case of a photo not properly saving,\u201d Google\u00a0reportedly said.</p>",
            "<p>In the meanwhile, if you find yourself with a camera app that unexpectedly quits after a photo is taken, it might be a good idea to manually close other applications open on the device. Android is usually good about doing that itself, but clearly this isn\u2019t always the case. Most phones should have a recent applications button (check the manufacturer website for your specific device) that shows all applications currently open. From there, you can quickly close any apps you don\u2019t plan on using, forcibly making more memory available to the camera app.</p>",

But one thing all of the leaks couldn\u2019t reveal were all the fancy software tricks that make the Pixels the finest Android phones around. Now we finally know the whole story.<br></p>",
            "<p>On the outside, the Pixel 3 doesn\u2019t look all that different from its predecessors. However, Google says it\u2019s using an entirely new matte glass on the back of the phones. It will come in three colors: black, white, and something Google is calling \u201cNot Pink.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>That standard Pixel 3 will feature a 5.5-inch screen, while the larger Pixel 3 XL will sport a 6.3-inch display. As suggested by the leaks, the Pixel 3 XL looks to maximize screen real estate with an edge-to-edge screen and a rather large notch on top, while the standard Pixel 3 offers a more traditional aesthetic with slim bezels on top and bottom. Thankfully, both phones feature the same flexible OLED touchscreen, so there shouldn\u2019t be any major differences in colors between the devices like we saw <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/google-is-investigating-an-issue-with-the-pixel-2-xl-s-1819765192\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/google-is-investigating-an-issue-with-the-pixel-2-xl-s-1819765192', {metric25:1})\">last year on the Pixel 2</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Elsewhere, Google says the Pixel 3's speakers should be about 40 percent louder than before and have been tuned with a special sound profile created by a Grammy-winning music producer. And to best show that off, Google will be giving new Pixel 3 owners six months of YouTube Music for free.</p>",
            "<p>Ok, so the new screen and speakers are nice, but since the beginning, Pixel phones\u2019 most important feature has been its camera. But that doesn\u2019t mean Google is hopping on the trend of adding tons of extra sensors to the back of its phones. Instead, Google is enhancing the camera software inside the phone to help you do things like take brighter, sharper, and more detailed photos even in challenging situations.</p>",
            "<p>On the Pixel 3, Google has created a custom imaging chip called the Pixel Visual Core and built it right into the phone, so you never have to worry about needing access to the cloud to make pics look their best. On top of that, there\u2019s also a bunch of new photo modes like Top Shot, which automatically selects what it thinks is the best shot out of the bunch. And if you don\u2019t like the photo the phone suggests, you can scroll through other images and select your favorite.</p>",
            "<p>Meanwhile, in lieu of adding a telephoto camera to the back of the Pixel 3, Google has created a new feature called Super Res Zoom that takes minutely different photos and then combines them in software to create a single, high-resolution pic. But the new photo features don\u2019t stop there, because Google says the Pixel 3's Night Sight tool will let users create stunning low-light images without even using the phone\u2019s flash. And for all the older Pixel phone owners out there, Night Sight is going to be available as an update later this year.</p>",
            "<p>In front, Google has upped the number of cams from one to two thanks to the addition of a new wide-angle camera so you can take group selfies with ease. Google claims the Pixel 3's front-facing camera offers a 184 percent larger field of view than an iPhone XS.</p>",
            "<p>And for a little bit of fun, Google is taking AR stickers and turning them into a whole new mode called Playground so you can add graphics and effects to pictures taken with both the front and rear cams. Google Lens is also getting an upgrade so that it will now work in real-time, which means you don\u2019t need to snap a picture first if you want to identify a specific pair of shoes or sunglasses. There\u2019s also Photo Booth Mode, Motion Auto Focus, and an even better Portrait Mode.</p>",
            "<p>To make Google\u2019s new phones easier to live with, the Pixel 3 is also the first phone to get new features that can screen and block calls from scammers, along with a new gesture called \u201cFlip to Shush\u201d that will automatically put the phone in silent mode when its lying face down. And to protect all your info, the Pixel 3 also includes a Google Titan security chip to help cut down on any potential viruses or malware.</p>",
            "<p>After getting a chance to test out the new Pixel 3s in person, it feels like I\u2019ve walked into an interesting dichotomy. On one hand, the Pixel 3's specs are relatively mundane. As you\u2019d expect from a flagship Android device, you get a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset and your choice of 64GB or 128GB of storage. But the Pixel 3's 4GB of RAM and lack of microSD expandability seems a little skimpy for a $800 phone. The standard Pixel 3's battery also feels undersized at just 2,915 mAh.</p>",
            "<p>However, Google has improved the overall usage of the handset with Qi-based wireless charging (which is a first for a Pixel), while retaining IP68 water-resistance and improving the dual front-facing speakers to be what one Google rep called \u201cloudest speakers\u201d on any mainstream handset.</p>",
            "<p>But the most interesting thing about the Pixel 3's design is its new glass back. It still has that same two-tone look seen on previous Pixels, except this time its one continuous panel, which should improve strength and rigidity. On top of that, the texture of the glass switches a third of the way down the phone to something that feels like the soft-touch finish you get on ThinkPads and other laptops. But according to Google Pixel product manager Peter Prunuske, the texture isn\u2019t just a coating that might rub off two or three months down the road, it\u2019s actually a new special etching technique that results in a more grippy, less drop-prone feel.</p>",
            "<p>The biggest changes for the Pixel 3, however, are its software upgrades. Throughout the phone, Google has tailored the Pixel\u2019s Android experience to be a smarter, more accommodating affair. That\u2019s most obvious when it comes to the camera, because while the Pixel 3's rear camera resolution has stayed pat at 12-MP, it\u2019s also the only flagship phone this year to feature just one camera on its back, even in its jumbo version. <br></p>",
            "<p>For its new Top Shot feature, Google has taken nods from high-end Olympus cameras by letting the phone capture images both before and after the shutter is pressed. From there, the phone can tell if someone was blinking or if a random object got in the way, which will prompt the phone to recommend a different frame that doesn\u2019t have those issues.</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 3's integration with the new Pixel Stand wireless charger is also surprisingly deep. Not only can you set your phone to automatically turn on Do-not-disturb mode when placed on the charger, by leveraging the Google Assistant, the Pixel Stand turns a Pixel 3 into a mini Home Hub of sorts.</p>",
            "<p>When paired, the Pixel 3 can show the live view from a Nest security camera anytime something triggers the motion sensor. Or you can use the Pixel 3 as a planning tool or smart speaker so you can see things like appointments or album art at a glance while you\u2019re getting ready in the morning. While I want to test the two together more, the Pixel Stand seems like its going to be a mandatory add-on for anyone who buys a Pixel 3.</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 3 is available for pre-order today starting at $800 for the standard Pixel 3, or $900 for the Pixel 3 XL. Shipments for pre-orders are expected to go out starting October 18th.</p>"

            "<p>That brings us to YouTube channel Front Page Tech (FPT), which\u2014shortly following Google\u2019s invite announcement\u2014<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXXHJeejpI&amp;lc=UgwImSaVB1OMiY1BOsl4AaABAg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXXHJeejpI&amp;lc=UgwImSaVB1OMiY1BOsl4AaABAg', {metric25:1})\">posted a video</a> claiming that someone from Google\u2019s hardware team had reached out to them, apparently asking for permission to use a clip from a previous FPT episode during the October 9 product event.</p>",

            "<p>Where things start to get weird is that for the last few weeks, FPT\u2019s Pixel 3 coverage has primarily consisted of videos hating on Google\u2019s rumored phone for being ugly and poorly designed. Front Page Tech also claims that Google has reached out to a \u201chandful\u201d of other YouTubers, allegedly asking the channels for permission to use their clips to create \u201ca very specific narrative,\u201d since \u201call of the clips are people mocking them about the leaks and how terrible the phone looks.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>This brings us to FPT\u2019s wild theory\u2014that, apparently, the only reason Google would ask for permission to play clips of people trashing the design of its leaked Pixel 3 is if those \u201cleaks\u201d were actually all just a smokescreen to distract the  media, while Google preps to show off entirely different devices in October.</p>",
            "<p>Now, speculation like this is as close to tinfoil hat territory as gadgets blogs will typically get, because if it\u2019s true, it might be one of the greatest misinformation campaign pulled off by a company in the internet age. </p>",
            "<p>However, the sheer number of Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL leaks seem somewhat suspect, too. Over the past couple weeks, almost every day new reports have popped up about unannounced Pixel phones  being sighted all over the globe.</p>",
            "<p>There was the case of <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/gigantic-leak-seemingly-blows-the-lid-off-googles-pixel-1828522906\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/gigantic-leak-seemingly-blows-the-lid-off-googles-pixel-1828522906', {metric25:1})\">multiple Russian blogs</a> that allegedly obtained final production Pixel 3 XL\u2019s after they had apparently been stolen while in transit.

And earlier this week, there was yet another Pixel 3 XL sighting after the phone had <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/someone-allegedly-left-a-pixel-3-xl-in-the-back-of-a-ly-1828776098\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/someone-allegedly-left-a-pixel-3-xl-in-the-back-of-a-ly-1828776098', {metric25:1})\">supposedly been left in the back of a Lyft.</a> </p>",
            "<p>Look, leaks get out. Shit happens. I get it. But the sheer number of alleged Pixel 3 leaks either means that Google has some of the most inept security when it comes to guarding info about unreleased devices, or there\u2019s simply more going on than all these leaks have shown so far. This is not typical for companies like Google.</p>",
            "<p>That said, it\u2019s still difficult to seriously buy into Front Page Tech\u2019s Google Pixel 3 Bamboozle theory. But in the back of my mind, I kind of hope he\u2019s right. 2018 hasn\u2019t exactly been the most interesting year for phones, and a major part of Google\u2019s fall launch event has seemingly already been spoiled, undercutting much of the excitement. If these fake leaks do result in some real surprises on October 9, then kudos to Google. I wish you the best in your trolling.</p>"

Over the weekend, two leaks popped up that could have some interesting consequences for what Google eventually announces later this year.<br></p>",
            "<p>The first piece of news comes from a post on the <a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-2-xl/how-to/white-pixel-3-xl-pictures-xda-exclusive-t3822357\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-2-xl/how-to/white-pixel-3-xl-pictures-xda-exclusive-t3822357', {metric25:1})\">XDA Developers forum</a> (<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/upSdt3Z\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://imgur.com/a/upSdt3Z', {metric25:1})\">Imgur mirror here</a>) showing what appears to be leaked photos of the upcoming Pixel 3.

            "<p>I mean, just look at it. That notch is huge.

But the notch on this alleged Pixel 3 is a bit different. The sheer size of that sensor cluster looks like it will dwarf everything else on the market, while also protruding into the screen quite significantly. It\u2019s a bold look for sure, but this might be an example of the whole notch trend taken a bit too far. </p>",
            "<p>The other piece of  Pixel news comes in the form of some code discovered by <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2018/07/28/pixel-stand-google-pixel-3-assistant/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://9to5google.com/2018/07/28/pixel-stand-google-pixel-3-assistant/', {metric25:1})\">9to5Google</a> hidden within the latest version of the Google app, which sports a mention of a trusted dock and a string that says:</p>",

        "author": "Sam Rutherford",
        "text": [
            "<p>The history of smartphone improvement has largely relied on companies cramming faster or more powerful components into the now ubiquitous glass slabs we carry around. But the Pixel 3 is something else. Instead of focusing on things like a brighter screen, tons of RAM, or multiple rear cameras, almost all of the Pixel 3's advantages come from a software-first mindset. This results in a smarter, more intuitive experience that feels very different from the hardware-driven approaches employed by many of Google\u2019s competitors. And while this isn\u2019t Google\u2019s first attempt at something like this, this third Pixel (we evaluated both it and the Pixel 3 XL) is the device that really pulls all of Google\u2019s efforts together and makes it feel special.<br></p>",
            "<p>For those unfamiliar with the latest version of Android 9 Pie, Google\u2019s mobile OS is what ties everything together. Clean and unfettered by add-ons or extra BS, Android on the Pixel 3 feels fast and snappy unlike anything else, though it\u2019s difficult to say if that is simply the result of speedier animations or superior software optimization. Then you add on things like Google\u2019s Living Wallpapers (which are endlessly entertaining), features from previous Pixels like Google\u2019s Now Playing song ID feature, and the new stuff like Call Screen. You end up with one of, if not the most considered out-of-the-box smartphones experiences, no customizing required. In fact, Google\u2019s Call Screen feature, which lets the Google Assistant intercept phone spam, may be the most important development since caller ID.</p>",
            "<p>But nowhere is Google\u2019s software prowess more evident than with the Pixel 3's cameras, which largely eschew the current trend of cramming as many sensors and lenses onto a phone as possible in favor of sophisticated computational photography. For the rear camera, this means that in everyday situations, the Pixel 3's lone 12-MP camera often has an edge over Apple\u2019s iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy in terms of colors and sharpness. And when it comes to things like cityscapes, Google\u2019s HDR+ mode is especially engaging as it merges multiple frames and exposures together to produce shots with more detail in bright spots and richer colors and shady areas, often defying what you think is possible from a smartphone camera.</p>",
            "<p>There\u2019s also the new Top Shot feature that uses machine learning to pick out bad shots where someone is blinking and suggest something better. And while it is a somewhat niche ability, when it works and you figure out how to tell that it\u2019s on (make sure the Motion toggle is turned on), Top Shot plus Google\u2019s gif-like Motion photos, burst mode, Photobooth mode, and AR-powered Playground mode means that there\u2019s always fun to be had when taking pictures. (More on Top Shot way below.)</p>",
            "<p>I also love the Pixel 3's front cameras, which take the phone\u2019s HDR processing and combines with it a second 8-MP camera to marry the best of what software and hardware can offer. That\u2019s because as long as you\u2019re not afraid of letting blemishes show, the Pixel 3's selfies are mystifyingly sharp in a way that often makes images from other $1,000 phones look bad. And when you want to snap a group selfie instead of a personal one, the Pixel 2's second cam lets you capture the same shockingly detailed images with a wide-angle field of view.<br></p>",
            "<p>As for the Pixel 3's general design, aside from the Pixel 3 XL\u2019s unmistakable notch (which I\u2019ve taken to calling \u201cthe bathtub\u201d), the physical dimensions of both the 5.5-inch Pixel 3 and 6.3-inch Pixel 3s have changed so little that Google\u2019s new official cases fit just as well on last year\u2019s phones. Instead, Google worked on improving the Pixel\u2019s build by adding new IP68 water-resistance, moving the volume rocker to the right to create a completely unblemished left side, and installing a new one-piece glass back.</p>",
            "<p>It not only increases durability when compared to the metal and glass construction of the Pixel 2, but the micro-etched soft-touch finish<br>on its bottom two-thirds is something that begs you not to put a case on the phone. Google even paid attention to little details like painting the inside of the phone\u2019s USB-C port black and adding a splash of color to the Clearly White and Not Pink models\u2019 power button. (Also, if you want to be accurate, Not Pink should really be called Sometimes Pink.)</p>",
            "<p>Inside, the Pixel 3 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset, which puts it on the same playing field as every other high-end Android phone. However, the Pixel 3's 4GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB storage feel a bit skimpy for a phone that starts at $800. That isn\u2019t to say the phone needs more memory, but when it comes to value, not having extra RAM, or a microSD card slot for the option to tack on even more storage feels bad for a flagship device. Thankfully, Google didn\u2019t ax the phone\u2019s dual front-facing speakers, which are way louder than before, and when combined with Google\u2019s Pixel Stand wireless charger, lets the Pixel 3 double as a mini smart speaker/home hub combo.</p>",
            "<p>That said, in terms of usefulness, one of the standard Pixel 3's biggest upgrades is a larger 2,915 mAh battery that lasted 10 hours and 50 minutes on our rundown test, a big jump up from the paltry 8:59 the Pixel 2 managed last year. Unfortunately, the same can\u2019t be said of the Pixel 3 XL whose 3,430 mAh battery is actually slightly smaller than what you get in a Pixel 2 XL, which resulted in the Pixel 3 XL\u2019s longevity increasing by less than 10 minutes to 11 hours and 24 minutes.<br></p>",
            "<p>And even though I\u2019ve had the Pixel 3 for less than a week, the phone has made a lasting impression. Google\u2019s dedication to software excellence is something that I\u2019d say has finally surpassed the iPhone when it comes to being the simplest, most no-nonsense handset, particularly for the less technically inclined crowd. More often than not, the Pixel 3 is thoughtful, and presents you with the tools and info you want, and streamlines the process so that accessing them isn\u2019t a hassle. However, I\u2019d be remiss not to mention the downsides of Google\u2019s game plan.</p>",
            "<p>The first and most obvious case are features like Top Shot mode. The Pixel\u2019s software makes it hard to tell if the feature is working because it\u2019s linked to the camera\u2019s seemingly unrelated Motion setting, which can be set to off, auto, and on, with auto and on potentially giving you different results. But the settings complications don\u2019t end there, because controls for major features like HDR+ aren\u2019t shown by default. That means out of the box, you can\u2019t actually turn on the phone\u2019s HDR+ enhanced mode, which is very different from standard HDR+, and to even see the option in the main camera UI, you need to go into the camera\u2019s advanced settings and enable the HDR+ control. Since the Pixel\u2019s HDR+ is the best and most important part of its picture taking process, it shouldn\u2019t be this difficult to turn on.</p>",
            "<p>But the true plight of a software-first mindset is that it can often feel like the user experience is never fully complete. Currently, the Pixel 3 is missing <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/i-broke-google-duplex-but-its-still-impressive-1827131546\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/i-broke-google-duplex-but-its-still-impressive-1827131546', {metric25:1})\">Duplex</a>, Google\u2019s AI-powered phone reception feature that can book appointments or make reservations over the phone on its own, as well as Night Sight mode, which is a special setting dedicated to capturing challenging low-light pictures. It\u2019s unclear when they will be available. These are two major things Google teased at the Pixel 3's launch event, and in the case of Night Sight mode, it\u2019s an even bigger bummer, because as is, the Pixel 3 often struggles in very low-light situations.</p>",
            "<p>And then there\u2019s the Pixel 3's big what if: How much better could the Pixel 3 be if Google cared a little more about both hardware and software? On the standard Pixel 3, its bezels look oversized and slightly wasteful compared to even 18-month old phones like the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-the-prettiest-phone-wins-1794526975\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-the-prettiest-phone-wins-1794526975', {metric25:1})\">Galaxy S8</a>, while the bathtub notch and big chin on the Pixel 3 XL appear even clunkier. Also how about those cameras.</p>",
            "<p>With the inclusion of a new dual-cam system in front, Google clearly understands the value of having multiple cameras, and yet the camera in back doesn\u2019t get any extra help. That\u2019s frustrating because even though the Pixel\u2019s Super Res Zoom feature is fine, it\u2019s still not as good as a real 2x optical lens. There\u2019s also a small concern regarding quality control because after turning them on for the first time, I noticed that the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL\u2019s OLED screens featured noticeably different color temperatures, which only gets worse the more off-center you are.</p>",
            "<p>Google says some variation between displays is a normal part of the manufacturing process, which is true. But this is the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/google-is-investigating-an-issue-with-the-pixel-2-xl-s-1819765192\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/google-is-investigating-an-issue-with-the-pixel-2-xl-s-1819765192', {metric25:1})\">second year in a row this has happened</a> with Pixel devices. I can\u2019t remember ever seeing such a big discrepancy when it comes to the displays on flagship Apple and Samsung handsets.</p>",
            "<p>However, don\u2019t let these things distract you from what Google has accomplished. The Pixel 3 more than any phone before shows an almost Nintendo-like philosophy where it\u2019s not the device\u2019s specs or hardware that matter most, but the overall user experience. And on the Pixel 3, Google has taken its software and made it king, solving problems and preventing others with intelligence and good design.</p>",
