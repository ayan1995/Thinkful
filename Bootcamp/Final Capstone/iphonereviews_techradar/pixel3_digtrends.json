            "<p>Google\u2019s <a href=\"https://store.google.com/\">annual hardware launch</a> event will take place on October 9 in New York City. The company sent out invites to media (including Digital Trends) confirming the date, which had leaked in August.</p>",
            "<p>The date and venue are a change of pace, considering the past two Google October events have taken place in San Francisco on October 4. The company is widely expected to launch a slew of hardware products ranging from smartphones to smart home devices.</p>",
            "<p>The highlights will be the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-pixel-3-news/\">Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL</a>, successors to last year\u2019s critically acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-2-review/\">Pixel 2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-2-xl-review/\">Pixel 2 XL</a> smartphones. There have been an alarmingly high number of leaks for the Pixel 3 series, and if true, we know quite a lot about the phones. It may be due to carelessness. Recently, someone left a Pixel 3 in the back of a Lyft. Separately, a group in Russia claims to have gotten its hands on a shipment of Pixel 3 XL smartphones and even posted an unboxing video, showing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M77bSscDJpo\">everything you get in the box</a>.</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 3 XL is expected to have a notch design, where a cutout at the top of the screen houses the front-facing camera. This has garnered some criticism, as the notch on the Pixel 3 XL looks unusually large. The smaller Pixel 3 may have a more traditional design, with slimmer bezels on the top and bottom. You can learn more about the two phones in our <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-pixel-3-news/\">Pixel 3 roundup</a>.</p>",
            "<p>As the new Pixel 3 devices are rumored to support wireless charging, leaks suggest Google will also announce <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-pixel-stand-news/\">the Pixel Stand</a> \u2014 a wireless charging dock that also turns the phone\u2019s screen into a Smart Display for Google Assistant, similar to what Lenovo offers with <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/smart-home-reviews/lenovo-smart-display-review/\">its Smart Display</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Google is also rumored to be launch its <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/google-assistant-smart-display/\">own Smart Display</a> to compete with the likes of <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/smart-home-reviews/amazon-echo-show-2017-review/\">Amazon\u2019s Echo Show</a>. It will essentially be a Google Home with a screen; you\u2019ll be able to access YouTube videos with your voice thanks to Google Assistant, and make video calls with Google\u2019s Duo app.</p>",
            "<p>Other products rumored to be on the docket are <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/google-pixelbook-2-october/\">two Pixelbooks</a>, which are <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/laptop-reviews/google-pixelbook-review/\">Chromebooks</a> from Google running Chrome OS, and a potential followup to the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/headphone-reviews/google-pixel-buds-review/\">Google Pixel Buds</a>. There\u2019s likely more Google will announce at the event that we haven\u2019t heard much about \u2014 for example, last year <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/google-clips-life-logging-camera/\">Google\u2019s Clips announcement</a> came as a surprise.</p>",
            "<p>Digital Trends will be on the scene in New York on October 9, reporting on everything Google will announce, so stay tuned.</p>"

            "<p>Now that the new phones are out, however, you might be wondering how you can get your hands on them for yourself. The phones are available in a few different colors, including \u201cjust black,\u201d \u201cclearly white,\u201d and \u201cnot pink.\u201d In case you\u2019re wondering how to get the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-review/\">Google Pixel 3</a> or <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-xl-review/\">Google Pixel 3 XL</a> for yourself, we put together this guide.</p>",
            "<p>As you might expect, the Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL are both now available for purchase\u00a0<a href=\"https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_3\">unlocked through the Google Store</a>. Here\u2019s a rundown of Pixel 3 unlocked pricing.</p>",
            "<p>The unlocked version of the phone is compatible with all major carriers \u2014 so if you\u2019re on T-Mobile, Sprint, or AT&amp;T, that\u2019s how you\u2019ll have to get the phones, considering the fact that they\u2019re exclusive to Verizon.</p>",
            "<p>As mentioned, the Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL are exclusively available on Verizon, meaning that you won\u2019t be able to get them through any other carrier except Google\u2019s own Project Fi.</p>",
            "<p>The Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL are now fully available\u00a0straight through the Verizon website or in a Verizon store, so if you\u2019re a Verizon customer or willing to make the switch, then you can pull the trigger now.</p>",
            "<p>Here\u2019s a rundown of pricing for the Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL on Verizon.</p>",
            "<p>If you\u2019re thinking about picking up the new Google Pixel 3 or Pixel 3 XL, this is the perfect time. Verizon is offering $400 of either phone with no trade-in required for Black Friday. The offer is available online now, and will be available in Verizon stores beginning Friday, November 23.</p>",
            "<p>As you would expect, the Google Pixel 3 is also available <a href=\"https://fi.google.com/about/phones/#pixel-3\">through Google\u2019s own Project Fi</a>, and it\u2019s available for the same price as it is unlocked \u2014 so you\u2019ll save a few bucks through Google compared to through Verizon. When it comes to deals, Project Fi is also offering a $799 service credit when you buy two Pixel 3 or Pixel 3 XL phones and add a new member to an existing group plan.</p>",

            "<p>If you plan to buy one of Google\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-pixel-3-news/\">Pixel 3</a> smartphones, then you had better look into protecting it. The glass back, which enables Qi wireless charging to work, is also going to be breakable, so it\u2019s a smart move to safeguard it. We\u2019ve had a quick peek at the available options, tried out a handful, and these are the best <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-review/\">Pixel 3</a>\u00a0cases so far for the brand-new phone. You may also be interested in safeguarding the display with one of the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-pixel-3-screen-protectors/\">best Pixel 3 screen protectors</a>.</p>",
            "<p>We\u2019re still testing out a variety of other Pixel 3 cases, but so far, these are top two favorites.</p>",
            "<p>The official fabric case from Google is the one we\u2019ve been using the most with our Pixel 3. Not surprisingly, it\u2019s a perfect fit, with generous openings for easy access to the fingerprint sensor and USB-C port. In fact, there\u2019s a gap above the USB-C port that makes it easy to swipe up from the bottom and use Android 9.0 Pie\u2019s new navigation shortcuts. It doesn\u2019t interfere with that stunning camera or the wireless charging either. The case features a plastic shell that\u2019s slightly flexible, wrapped in a durable, gray fabric with soft, mint green padding on the inside. The power button cover is mint green to match the white Pixel 3, and there are blue, black, and pink versions of this case as well. The volume rocker protrudes a little, but it\u2019s camouflaged by the finish. The case is almost flush with the screen at the front and it\u2019s slim, so we wouldn\u2019t expect much drop protection from this case, but it will ward off scrapes, it\u2019s very comfortable to hold, and it definitely enhances your grip.</p>",
            "<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong></strong></p>",
            "<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/go/862bbf335ee6f5c6b85424d31fea81cb952199d6/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"m-aff-button h-affiliate-link trackable\" data-event-type=\"affiliate-click\" data-event-action=\"manual\" data-event-param=\"Google\">Google</a></p>",
            "<p>With photography specialists in mind, Moment make protective cases for the Pixel 3 that look stylish and also support Moment\u2019s lens range, which includes Wide, Tele Portrait, and Superfish lenses that start at $90. The shell is made of tough, fairly thick plastic with well-defined button covers and precise openings. There\u2019s plenty of room around the USB-C port and a sloping cutout for the fingerprint sensor. The surround of the camera lens has a special locking system that makes it easy to clip on extra lenses, but these cases can be used without them and still look good. Our pick is the one with the flecked cream finish with the tan leather, but there\u2019s a black case with a canvas panel on the back, as well as a black case with a walnut panel. With microfiber on the inside and a raised lip around the screen, we think this case should offer decent drop protection.</p>",

            "<p>If you\u2019re a fan of the Pixel 3\u2019s look and you don\u2019t want to cover it entirely, then you might fancy this translucent offering from Incipio. Crafted from its proprietary Flex2O material, this is a lightweight but highly durable case for the Pixel 3. The bottom portion of the case echoes the Pixel\u2019s two-tone finish to add a touch of style, but it\u2019s a fairly plain offering with accurate openings, button covers, raised bezels to protect the screen, and a subtle Incipio logo on the side. It offers protection against scratches and drops from up to 3 feet.</p>",
            "<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong></strong></p>",

            "<p>This case from Speck strikes a nice balance between protection and the desire to show off your Pixel 3\u2019s style. It\u2019s a completely clear case with an anti-yellowing coating and it promises to protect your Pixel 3 from drops of up to 8 feet. The bumper section is reinforced with a dual-layer shock-absorbing barrier, and there\u2019s a raised bezel all the way around the screen to ensure it never touches down. It\u2019s quite a chunky case that definitely adds some bulk, but it\u2019s comfortable to hold and highly protective. There are no issues with the generous openings, and it won\u2019t interfere with <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-wireless-phone-chargers/\">wireless charging</a> either.</p>",

            "<p>We\u2019re big fans of Nomad\u2019s Horween leather cases and they age beautifully, developing their own patina over time. But don\u2019t be fooled into thinking that these Pixel 3 cases are all style and no substance because there\u2019s a tough polycarbonate shell inside, with a TPE bumper that can cope with falls of up to 6 feet. There\u2019s plenty of room around the cutouts, and you\u2019ll find subtle button covers for the power and volume rocker. The case also extends a little at the front to protect the screen. Wireless charging works just fine with this case on.</p>",

            "<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/go/636a080c6012d01946e356b636196da7819ee4b6/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"m-aff-button h-affiliate-link trackable\" data-event-type=\"affiliate-click\" data-event-action=\"manual\" data-event-param=\"Nomad\">Nomad</a></p>",
            "<p>If you tend to fumble your phones a lot, then this highly protective case from Tech21 is for you. When your Pixel 3 is wearing this cas,e you can drop it with impunity, because it will safeguard your phone from falls of up to 12 feet (not that you\u2019d actually want to). Tech21 imbues the flexible bumper with its special FlexShock material, which will prevent any impact shock from penetrating. It\u2019s a little chunky, but you\u2019ll find good-sized openings and tactile button covers that are easy to find. Our pick is the eye-catching ultraviolet version, but you can opt for a more reserved smokey black if you prefer. Each is translucent, with a special check pattern on the back panel.</p>",
            "<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong></strong></p>",
            "<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/go/9b78da7f959c91e6854a035517b2c8e6cd1e9acc/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"m-aff-button h-affiliate-link trackable\" data-event-type=\"affiliate-click\" data-event-action=\"manual\" data-event-param=\"Tech21\">Tech21</a></p>",
            "<p>Here\u2019s a relatively tough case that combines malleable TPU with a hard polycarbonate frame for solid protection from knocks and falls. The matte, textured finish on the back enhances grip and won\u2019t pick up grubby fingerprints. There\u2019s also an extended lip around the screen to prevent it from touching down on any surface. Tapered openings for the fingerprint sensor and camera and well-defined button covers round out a good case.</p>",

            "<p>For people who hate thick cases and prominent branding, the Totallee Thin case could be ideal. It\u2019s extremely thin at 0.02 inches thick, it\u2019s so light you\u2019ll barely feel it, and it has no logos or garish patterns. The matte black version is pictured, but it also comes in frosted clear and glossy clear varieties. You can\u2019t expect solid drop protection from a case this slight, but it will guard against scratches and minor bumps.</p>",

            "<p>This crystal-clear case from Ringke is very affordable, but still offers reasonable protection, with a hard, transparent polycarbonate back panel and a flexible, clear TPU bumper. The corners are reinforced for impact protection, and there\u2019s a lanyard hole for anyone who wants to attach a strap. You\u2019ll find accurate cutouts and thin button covers offering easy access to everything. You can also pick up this case with a smoke black translucent bumper.</p>",

            "<p>You may like the eye-catching, ridged look of this Single Fit Label Series case from VRS Design. It\u2019s like a small, tough suitcase designed to envelop your Pixel 3 and guard it from drop damage or scratches. It features raised edges around the screen, tactile button covers, and beveled openings for the fingerprint sensor and camera. You can pick it up in white or black and each case features a burst of color in the red/orange label tag.</p>",

            "<p>The original Pixel is getting on a bit and the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-pixel-3-news/\">Pixel 3</a> offers some upgrades over the still-excellent Pixel 2. If you\u2019re thinking of upgrading, or wondering if last year\u2019s Pixel might be good enough, then we have you covered right here. Learn exactly what separates the three Pixel generations as we compare them.</p>",
            "<p>A look at the spec sheet reveals the Pixel 3 has the popular Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor inside \u2014 the same chip you\u2019ll find in everything from <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review/\">Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 9</a> to <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/sony-xperia-xz3-review/\">Sony\u2019s Xperia XZ3</a>. It\u2019s fast and plenty powerful. The Pixel 2 has last year\u2019s Snapdragon 835 and the original Pixel has the Snapdragon 821. Each new generation of Qualcomm\u2019s processor brings speed boosts and power efficiency enhancements. The Pixels all have 4GB of RAM.</p>",
            "<p>There\u2019s 64GB or 128GB of storage in the Pixel 2 and Pixel 3, and you can also get a 128GB Pixel. The original, entry-level Pixel offered just 32GB of storage, which is definitely not enough, especially since there\u2019s no MicroSD card slot in any of these phones.</p>",
            "<p>Battery size hasn\u2019t changed much, going from 2,770mAh in the original to 2,700mAh in the Pixel 2 to 2,915mAh in the Pixel 3. Although it has a slightly larger screen to power, it also boasts better power efficiency. Sadly, these are all phones that will require daily charging, but the Pixel 3 is the only one to offer support for Qi wireless charging.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Google Pixel 3</strong></p>",
            "<p>Google\u2019s understated style could also be described as dated. It has been slow to react to the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/bezel-less-phone-comparison/\">bezel-less trend</a>, with each Pixel release featuring unashamedly large bezels around the screen compared to contemporaries. The Pixel 3 is certainly the most modern-looking of the trio. While the back of the Pixel 2 had a two-tone finish that combines matte aluminum with a glass portion at the top, the Pixel 3 is all glass. In the original Pixel, the glass took up perhaps a third of the back with the fingerprint sensor embedded in it, but in the Pixel 2, that glass portion shrank and the fingerprint sensor was found in the metal below. The Pixel 3 retains a similar style, but the back is all glass now. Only the original Pixel had a 3.5mm headphone jack, the newer Pixels rely on a single USB-C port instead.</p>",
            "<p>The original Pixel was only splash-resistant, but the Pixel 2 and Pixel 3 can be fully submerged in water without sustaining any damage. The relatively small size makes each Pixel easy to handle, and the original Pixel and the Pixel 2 should cope with falls better than their more delicate successor. The Pixel 2 and 3 both boast Gorilla Glass 5, while the original Pixel has Gorilla Glass 4.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Google Pixel 3</strong></p>",
            "<p>All three of the Pixels boast OLED screens, but while the Pixel 2 and original Pixel have 5-inch displays with 1,920 x 1,080-pixel resolutions, the Pixel 3 has a bigger, 5.5-inch display with a resolution of 2,160 x 1,080 pixels. The shift to a 19:9 aspect ratio, from 16:9 in the first two Pixels, gives you a decent extra chunk of screen real estate without increasing the size of the handset \u2014 in fact, the Pixel 3 is slightly smaller.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Google Pixel 3</strong></p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 2 has been our <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-camera-phones/\">reigning camera phone champion</a> for the last year. Despite relying on a single 12.2-megapixel lens, it takes consistently excellent shots in all kinds of different conditions \u2014 and it appears Google has stuck with it for the Pixel 3. The original Pixel was no slouch either, with a 12.3 megapixel camera. The Pixel 3 offers a range of new and exclusive A.I. smarts in the camera that enable it to snap shots before and after you press the shutter button, so it can choose the best one, where your subject is facing the camera, smiling, and has their eyes open. There\u2019s also an A.I.-enhanced zoom capability, automatic subject tracking, so you don\u2019t have to tap to refocus if you or your subject move, and improved low-light performance.</p>",
            "<p>The first two Pixels have 8-megapixel front-facing cameras, but the Pixel 3 kicks it up a notch with a dual-lens, front-facing camera that pairs two 8-megapixel lenses, one telephoto and one wide angle. That enables you to get a solid bokeh effect, with blurred backgrounds on your portrait photos. The second lens is wide angle, allowing for wider group selfie shots, or enabling you to capture more of your background.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Google Pixel 3</strong></p>",
            "<p>Google\u2019s Pixel phones are mercifully free of manufacturer meddling, with the purest stock Android, which enables some of the best performance you\u2019ll see on an Android phone. They\u2019re also the first devices to get software updates, as Google can roll them out whenever it likes. We\u2019re giving the Pixel 3 the win here because it will continue to be updated for longer than the other two, but the software experience on these phones is close to identical, with <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/android-9-pie-review/\">Android 9.0 Pie</a> on all of them.</p>",
            "<p>Some of the new Google Assistant capabilities, like the ability to screen your calls to weed out spam and the ability to make calls and makes restaurant reservations for you, will be rolling out on the new Pixels first.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Google Pixel 3</strong></p>",
            "<p>Google has something of a no-frills approach to its smartphones, preferring to focus on a slick, well-rounded experience. While there are no glaring flaws here, there also isn\u2019t much to point to in terms of special features. The Pixel 3 sets itself apart from the other two with its dual-lens selfie-camera and the A.I. enhancements in the main shooter.</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 3 is also the only one with Qi wireless charging support, and if you charge it using a Google Pixel Stand, you get access to schedule and commute information and more via one-touch shortcuts or voice commands.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Google Pixel 3</strong></p>",
            "<p>The first two Pixel phones cost $650 at launch for the lowest-capacity model, but the original Pixel can be found for significantly less now and we expect to see price drops on the Pixel 2, now that the Pixel 3 is here. The Pixel 3 costs significantly more at $800 for the 64GB version and $900 for the 128GB version.</p>",
            "<p>Stock issues impacted the original Pixel and the Pixel 2 as Google seemed to be caught off guard by the demand, but we don\u2019t expect to see a repeat with the Pixel 3. Google has offered each Pixel unlocked and ready for use on any major U.S. carrier, and you can buy the Pixel 3 on an installment plan if you prefer.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s somewhat surprising to see how little the Pixel has changed in three generations. The Pixel 3 is definitely the best of the bunch, but we\u2019re talking about refinements here, with a slightly more modern design that squeezes in more screen and a better front-facing camera. It\u2019s also faster and has a little more stamina than its predecessors, but there are no giant leaps. If your budget is limited and you can snag a discounted Pixel 2, we think it will serve you well for some time to come. If you\u2019re looking to upgrade, we think you\u2019ll feel the difference if you\u2019re trading in an original Pixel, but Pixel 2 owners can stick with that model for another year.</p>"

            "<p>There are plenty of contenders in the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/pixel-3-xl-vs-galaxy-note-9-oneplus-6t-mate-20-pro/\">Android heavyweight division</a>, but bigger isn\u2019t always better. Unfortunately, if you\u2019re looking for a truly great Android phone and you don\u2019t want something that\u2019s too big to manage one-handed, then your choices are a bit limited.</p>",
            "<p>Arguably the two best pocket-friendly Android phones come from Samsung and Google. But which is better? Find out as we pit Google Pixel 3 versus the Samsung Galaxy S9 in a variety\u00a0 of categories to pick a winner.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s no surprise to find that both these phones feature this year\u2019s most popular flagship processor \u2014 the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845. They also both have 4GB of RAM. You can expect smooth performance and no issues running the latest games and apps with either phone, however, the Pixel 3 feels considerably smoother, thanks to Google\u2019s software skills. It also performed slightly better in our benchmark tests. While you can pick up either with 64GB or 128GB of storage, the Galaxy S9 also has a 256GB variant and has a Micro SD card slot for expansion.</p>",
            "<p>Sadly, battery life is an Achilles\u2019 heel for both phones. The S9 has a touch more capacity, but whichever one you choose, busy days will see a charge deplete well before bedtime. Both support fast charging, but the Pixel 3 charges more quickly than the S9. Both also support Qi wireless charging at up to 10W.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Google Pixel 3</strong></p>",
            "<p>Samsung has refined its curved design to near perfection in the Galaxy S9. The screen curves into the metal frame and so does the glass back, and it feels great in hand. The fingerprint sensor is on the back, just below the central camera lens. The front is almost completely screen, with thin slivers of bezel top and bottom.</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 3 is a lot less alluring at first glance, but the etched glass back makes it comfortable to hold and also allows it to duck the usual fingerprint smudgefest. There\u2019s a central fingerprint sensor on the back, but the camera lens is at the top left. The screen on the front is slightly smaller than the S9\u2019s and there are bigger bezels top and bottom, though this does allow for front-facing speakers.</p>",
            "<p>Comparing the two, the S9 is a tiny bit bigger in every direction and a touch heavier. We find the Pixel 3 more comfortable to handle. It\u2019s also a little too easy to accidentally cover the bottom-firing speaker on the S9 when you hold it in landscape to watch a movie or play a game. Your pick here will likely come down to personal preference and you should try to get your hands on both before choosing. The S9 certainly has more style, but the Pixel 3 feels just right.</p>",
            "<p>They\u2019re both glass, so you\u2019ll want a <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-pixel-3-cases/\">case for protection</a>. They also both have IP68 ratings, which means you don\u2019t have to worry about rain or even submersion in shallow water.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Tie</strong></p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s a testament to Samsung\u2019s design skill that it has managed to pack a 5.8-inch screen into the Galaxy S9. Even the ill-fated Note 7 only had a 5.7-inch screen, though it\u2019s important to remember that screen size is measured diagonally, and one of the ways modern smartphone makers have packed bigger screens in is to stretch the aspect ratio. In other words, they\u2019re taller but not as wide. The S9 has an 18.5:9 aspect ratio, while the Note 7 was 16:9. The Pixel 3 has a 5.5-inch screen with an 18:9 aspect ratio.</p>",
            "<p>Samsung\u2019s AMOLED technology has led the field in smartphone screens for years, but the competition is catching up. Google also has an OLED screen in the Pixel 3, but at a resolution of 2,160 x 1,080 pixels, it isn\u2019t quite as sharp as the S9\u2019s display, which goes up to 2,960 x 1,440 pixels. Even with the extra size, the S9 scores a pixel-per-inch (PPI) rating of 570, compared to 443 for the Pixel 3.</p>",
            "<p>Both these displays are gorgeous and work well for reading, movies, or games, but Samsung\u2019s S9 display has the edge.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S9</strong></p>",
            "<p>On paper, both have two single-lens main cameras rated around 12 megapixels, and both are good, but the Pixel 3 gets consistently better shots than the Galaxy S9. In fact, the Pixel 3 is our reigning <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-camera-phones/\">camera phone champion</a>. It\u2019s very fast and easy to use, enabling you to get wonderful photos without any fiddling. Google\u2019s software smarts allow it to stitch together multiple shots to ensure every photo is sharp, with low noise and perfect contrast. There\u2019s an excellent portrait mode that blurs the background and captures lovely photos of people. It also performs brilliantly in low light thanks to Night Sight.</p>",
            "<p>The Galaxy S9 camera is no slouch. It has a variable aperture that enables it to get the most from different lighting conditions, as well as a portrait mode, called Selective Focus, but it struggles to compete with the Pixel 3 on that front. There are also a lot of extras, like Super Slow Motion, which is very cool, and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/ar-emojis-samsung-galaxy-s9-test/\">AR Emojis</a>, whichares not. The Pixel 3 wins the front-facing camera battle as well, with dual 8-megapixel lenses, which enable you to take wide selfies, ideal for squeezing in groups or getting some background into your selfies. Throw in the fact that you get free, unlimited, full-resolution photo and video storage with the Pixel 3 and it\u2019s a clear winner here.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Google Pixel 3</strong></p>",
            "<p>If your idea of a Samsung phone is TouchWiz, then you\u2019ll be glad to know that the manufacturer has overhauled its user interface and slimmed things down significantly. The S9 launched with Android 8.0 Oreo and Samsung\u2019s Experience user interface over the top. Samsung adds some customization options and features that are useful, and some that aren\u2019t. We\u2019re also not sold on the usefulness or usability of Samsung\u2019s apps compared to Google\u2019s apps, and Bixby is light-years behind Google Assistant. Although an exception worth noting here is Samsung Pay, which has much wider compatibility at point-of-sale than <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/what-is-google-pay/\">Google Pay</a> does.</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 3 launched with Android 9.0 Pie and some exclusive Google software features like Now Playing, which tells you what song is playing, and Screen Call, which can screen calls for you, giving you a real-time transcript. The Android experience on the Pixel 3 is as Google intended, and it\u2019s by far the slickest we\u2019ve ever experienced on an Android phone. The S9 is set to get Android 9.0 Pie and the new One UI at the time of writing. Going forward the Pixel 3 will get both security and Android feature updates much faster than the S9 will.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Google Pixel 3</strong></p>",
            "<p>We\u2019ve mentioned Now Playing and Screen Call, and we\u2019ve also discussed the unique features in the Pixel 3\u2019s camera. Night Sight was added as an update after release, but there\u2019s one more A.I. feature we\u2019re still waiting for: <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-duplex-hands-on/\">Google Duplex</a>, which will enable Google Assistant on your Pixel 3 to make appointments or reservations for you.</p>",
            "<p>Samsung offers a lot more in the way of special features, but it feels like quantity over quality. If you\u2019re interested in having your phone double up as a desktop, then DeX mode might pique your interest. We aren\u2019t impressed by Bixby or AR Emojis, but we do love the Super Slow Motion video option.</p>",
            "<p>Google\u2019s special features are things we use frequently, whereas Samsung\u2019s aren\u2019t.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Google Pixel 3<br>\n</strong></p>",
            "<p>The Samsung Galaxy S9 starts at $720 and you can get it and use it with any major carrier. If you shop around, you\u2019ll be able to find one for a fair bit less than that now. The Google Pixel 3 starts at $800, but we have also seen it discounted, so keep an eye out if you want to buy one. You can find the Pixel 3 at Verizon, or buy an unlocked handset that will work with any major carrier.</p>",
            "<p>The Google Pixel 3 is quite simply the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-android-phones/\">best Android phone</a> you can buy right now, so it naturally wins out overall. It offers slick performance, amazing software features, and the best camera you\u2019ll find in a smartphone. If you\u2019re used to Samsung phones, and you find value in the extras that the S9 offers, then it could still be the right choice for you, especially since it\u2019s likely to cost you a fair bit less. But we\u2019d pick the Pixel 3 every time.</p>"

            "<p>You can check out our <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-review/\">Pixel 3</a> and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-xl-review/\">Pixel 3 XL reviews</a> for our impressions, and check out our picks for <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-pixel-3-cases-version-1539691504/\">best Pixel 3</a> and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-pixel-3-xl-cases/\">Pixel 3 XL cases</a>\u00a0to add some protection to these all-glass phones.</p>",
            "<p>One of our favorite features on the Pixel 3 actually debuted on the Pixel 2. Now Playing uses on-device machine learning to listen to the music in your surroundings \u2014 whether you\u2019re in a cafe or a restaurant, the Pixel 3 will try to find the name of the song, and it will display it on the lock screen and as a notification. Don\u2019t worry, this is all being done offline, and \u201cnever sends songs or conversations to Google.\u201d It\u2019s turned off by default, so here\u2019s how to turn it on.</p>",
            "<p>Head to the phone\u2019s Settings either by pulling down the notification shade all the way down and tapping the gear icon, or by finding the Settings app in the app drawer. Now go to\u00a0<em>Sound &gt; Now Playing </em>and tap on <em>Show songs on lock screen</em>. You can also choose to get notifications here or turn them off. Now Playing has improved on the Pixel 3 with a new \u201cNow Playing History\u201d section. Tap on it, and you\u2019ll see a history of the songs identified by the phone sorted by date. Even better, tap on one of the songs, and you\u2019ll get direct access to play the song on any installed music service like YouTube Music.</p>",
            "<p>This is also a good time to make sure your Ambient Display is turned on so you can see these music alerts by heading to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Display &gt; Advanced &gt; Ambient Display</em>.</p>",
            "<p>The fingerprint sensor on the back of the Google Pixel 3 does more than just unlock your phone. You can swipe your finger down or up on it to pull the notification drawer down or push it up. It\u2019s especially\u00a0handy on the Pixel 3 XL, where it can be hard to reach the top of the large 6.3-inch screen. It\u2019s turned off by default, so here\u2019s how to toggle it on:\u00a0Head to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; System &gt; Gestures &gt; Swipe fingerprint for notifications</em> and tap the toggle. Now swipe down or up on the fingerprint sensor, and you\u2019ll see the notification drawer magically move up and down.</p>",
            "<p>Google\u2019s Active Edge feature that lets you squeeze the sides of the phone to activate Google Assistant makes a return. You\u2019ll be prompted with the option to configure this during the phone\u2019s setup process, but there\u2019s a way to tweak the sensitivity afterward. You can also turn it off completely if you want to just rely on pressing and holding down the home button, or on tapping the Assistant icon in the Google Search bar. Head to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; System &gt; Gestures &gt; Active Edge</em>. Here you can manually move the dot on the slider around to require a firm or light squeeze to activate Assistant, and there\u2019s an option to turn it off completely below, or to make it work even when the screen is off.</p>",
            "<p>Active Edge isn\u2019t purely to access Google Assistant either. You can squeeze the phone to silence an alarm, timers, notifications, and incoming calls, and you can toggle this off in the same screen.</p>",
            "<p>One of the new software features exclusive to the Pixel 3 and 3 XL is \u2018Flip to Shhh,\u2019 which, as it sounds, silences your device when you flip the phone on a table (display facing down). It\u2019s a quick way to turn on Do Not Disturb, especially if your phone is vibrating loudly in a meeting or interview. Head over to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Digital Wellbeing &gt; Flip to Shhh</em> and toggle it on. Alternatively, the setting option is also available in\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; System &gt; Gestures &gt; Flip to Shhh.\u00a0</em></p>",
            "<p>While you\u2019re in the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-use-google-digital-wellbeing-android-9-pie/\">Digital Wellbeing menu</a>, we recommend taking a look at Google\u2019s options to help curtail smartphone usage. We don\u2019t think app timers are too useful (unless you\u2019re setting one up for a child), but we do recommend turning on Wind Down, which will turn the display to grayscale at night and will automatically turn on Do Not Disturb mode. It\u2019s a great way of staying off your phone before bed, and not getting distracted. Just tap\u00a0<em>Wind Down</em>, choose a start and end time, and you can customize whether you want Do Not Disturb turned on, as well as a grayscale screen, or even whether the phone should turn on Night Light (which turns the screen yellow <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/does-blue-light-ruin-sleep-we-ask-an-expert/\">to protect from blue light</a>).</p>",
            "<p>There\u2019s no full on \u201cdark mode\u201d in the Pixel 3, but there\u2019s a way to make the app drawer and notification drawer a darker color. It\u2019s easier on the eyes when you\u2019re in a dark room and don\u2019t want to be blinded. By default this setting is on \u201cAutomatic (based on wallpaper),\u201d which means if you have a dark wallpaper, the notification and app drawer will swap to a dark theme automatically, and vice versa if you have a lighter wallpaper. If you want to manually configure it, just head to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Display &gt; Advanced &gt; Device Theme &gt;\u00a0</em>and choose\u00a0<em>Light\u00a0</em>or <em>Dark.</em></p>",
            "<p>There are several ways to have your phone bypass the lock screen. You can set up <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-use-android-smart-lock/\">Smart Lock</a>, so your phone will not ask you to unlock it when you\u2019re at home, or you can set it to trust connected Bluetooth devices so your smartwatch or headphones will keep your phone unlocked. But there may be a few moments when you may want to quickly lock down your phone to make sure no one can access it without your lock screen password. Google has made it easy, but you\u2019ll need to turn this function on first.</p>",
            "<p>Head over to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Security &amp; Location &gt; Lock Screen Preferences &gt;\u00a0</em>and toggle on\u00a0<em>Show Lockdown Option.</em> Now when you press and hold the power button, you\u2019ll see an option to \u201cLockdown\u201d the phone. This turns Smart Lock off, doesn\u2019t let you use the fingerprint sensor, and hides notifications from the lock screen. It\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll need to use this feature much, but it can be very handy in certain scenarios.</p>",
            "<p>Tired of your screen constantly rotating when you shift orientation? Auto-rotate is a handy feature, but it can be a bit too sensitive. A new smart rotation tool in Android 9 Pie makes it so that you can leave the auto-rotate toggle turned off all the time. How does it work? Well, first you actually do need to turn screen auto-rotate off. Pull down the notification bar all the way down until you see the quick settings tiles. Find <em>Auto-rotate</em>, and tap on it to turn it off (if it was on already). Now go into any app and rotate your screen to landscape \u2014 you\u2019ll see a rotate icon pop up next to the home button. Tap it, and the screen\u2019s contents will rotate to the correct orientation and it will stay locked. When you go back into portrait orientation, the button will pop up again, and just press it to lock it back to portrait. It\u2019s a much smarter implementation than having to deal with an overly sensitive auto-rotate system.</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 3 takes excellent photographs, and if you\u2019re a professional photographer, you may want further control over editing those images. There\u2019s now a handy way of making sure the Pixel 3 captures JPEGs and RAW file formats. Open the camera app by double tapping the power button, or by finding it in the app drawer. Tap\u00a0<em>More</em> then\u00a0<em>Settings</em>. Go to the\u00a0<em>Advanced\u00a0</em>tab, and then toggle on\u00a0<em>RAW+JPEG control</em>. You\u2019ll now see a separate album in the Google Photos app that will let you access these RAW photo files. Keep in mind, this uses up more device storage.</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL don\u2019t pack the biggest batteries inside, and they left us wanting more. You\u2019ll want to make sure you have enough juice to last you a full day, and you can have Battery Saver mode automatically kick in when your phone hits a certain battery level. To do this, head to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Battery Saver &gt;\u00a0</em><em>Turn On Automatically</em>.\u00a0A slider will show up, and you can move the dot around to choose at what percentage you want Battery Saver mode to kick in. Battery Saver turns off some features in the phone and restricts background use for a few apps, which in turn helps extend battery life.</p>",
            "<p>A lot of people complained about the Pixel 2 XL\u2019s screen last year looking a bit muted, so Google added a few display configurations to appease. We\u2019ve yet to see any major problems with the screen on the Pixel 3 XL, but in both phones you will see the same screen color options. Head to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Display &gt; Advanced &gt; Colors</em>. There are three options to choose from: Natural, Boosted, and Adaptive. As the name suggests, Natural gives you the most realistic-looking colors, while Boosted cranks up the saturation.\u00a0The default Adaptive mode similarly increases the saturation, but it ensures things like skin tone and reds are toned down, according to <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2018/10/09/google-pixel-3-displays-cameras-more/\">9to5Google</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Those are some of the key settings we think you should change, but we have plenty more <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-pixel-3-tips-and-tricks/\">tips and tricks</a> to customize your Pixel 3 and 3 XL further. Enjoy your new phone!</p>"

            "<p>Google was one of the first manufacturers to support <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/esim-explainer/\">eSIM cards</a> as part of its Google Fi network, and it put its money where its mouth was by equipping the Pixel 3 with eSIM support. But not many carriers supported eSIM, so the rollout to the new, less physical format has been a tad slow.</p>",
            "<p>However, Google has just announced it is rolling out eSIM support for the Pixel 3 for multiple carriers in multiple countries. According to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/12/3/18123947/google-esim-support-pixel-3-sprint-international\">The Verge</a>, you can soon expect to see eSIM support for Sprint in the U.S., EE in the U.K., Airtel and Reliance Jio in India, and for Truphone and Gigsky in a bunch of other countries. In addition, Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone in Germany will be going one better and will soon be selling Pixel 3 phones with an eSIM.</p>",
            "<p>Google\u2019s clever A.I. mode, Night Sight, is now rolling out to the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL as an update to the Google Camera app. It stitches together multiple frames to reduce noise and\u00a0boost colors and brightness for photos captured in very dark environments. You\u2019ll find the new mode in the <em>More</em> section of the camera app, but it should pop up as a suggestion when appropriate. The new mode works with the main camera and the front-facing camera. We\u2019re impressed by the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-pixel-night-sight/\">results we\u2019ve gotten with Night Sight</a> so far.</p>",
            "<p>At Google\u2019s Pixel event earlier this year, the company announced Playground, a new Pixel camera mode that essentially allows users to display augmented reality characters in their photos. At launch, the feature offered Marvel characters, weather, signs, and more. Now, in celebration of National Cat Day, it\u2019s getting some cats. Within the Playground feature, you will be able to add both cats and dogs, after which they will interact with each other on the screen, run around a scene, and so on.</p>",
            "<p>One of the most interesting new features to be shown off during the launch of the Pixel 3 was the ability for the phones to screen phone calls and block spam. When you get a call from an unknown number, for example, you can simply hit the \u201cScreen Call\u201d button, and Google Assistant will talk to the caller instead of you. The feature will be available on the Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL later this month, and will be coming to the original Pixel and Pixel 2 in November.</p>",
            "<p>The Google Pixel 3 XL may be getting good early reviews, but there is one feature that reviewers have consistently mentioned in a less-than-positive light \u2014 the huge notch. Thankfully, however, it seems as though Google is developing a way to hide the notch. The new feature is currently available in Android\u2019s developer options and essentially puts a black bar at the top of the display. The result is that the phone basically looks like it has a large bezel at the top, though some may prefer that look to the notch. We tried out the new feature and you can see what it looks like below.</p>",
            "<p>Perhaps the most interesting addition to the Pixel\u2019s software is that it will be getting <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-duplex-hands-on/\">Google Duplex</a>, Google\u2019s ultra-realistic human-sounding version of Assistant that can call restaurants to make bookings. For now, the service will only call restaurants that don\u2019t have online booking systems, which already have Assistant support. Initially, Google is only bringing the feature to New York, Atlanta, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area \u2014 though it\u2019s likely the feature will roll out to more areas soon after.</p>",
            "<p>At first glance, the Google Pixel 3 looks a lot like the Pixel 2, but look closer and you\u2019ll see that Google has cut the bezels down, enabling it to pack a 5.5-inch OLED screen into a body that\u2019s actually a hair smaller than its predecessor\u2019s. Not only has the screen size jumped by half an inch, but it\u2019s also sharper, with a 2,160 x 1,080-pixel resolution that scores it a respectable 443 pixels-per-inch (ppi). Thankfully, there\u2019s still room for\u00a0stereo front-facing speakers.</p>",
            "<p>Flip around to the back and we find the same two-tone design as previous Pixels, with a fingerprint sensor in the middle and the camera lens at the top left, but this time the back is all glass, which allows the Pixel 3 to support wireless charging. Alongside the usual understated black version, there\u2019s also white with a mint green power button, and an all-new \u201cNot Pink\u201d option with an orange power button.</p>",
            "<p>There are no real surprises inside, where we find Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 845 processor backed by 4GB of RAM. Storage options are 64GB or 128GB and there\u2019s no room for a MicroSD card to expand on that. There\u2019s also no room for a 3.5mm audio jack, so you\u2019ll have to make use of the USB-C port or Bluetooth 5, but you do get USB-C earbuds in the box.</p>",
            "<p>Naturally, the Pixel 3 runs the latest Android 9 Pie version and Google has added various enhancements. In addition to Qi wireless charging, there\u2019s also fast-charging support for the 2,915 mAh battery. That\u2019s slightly bigger than the battery in the Pixel 2 and, coupled with the newer, more efficient processor, should translate to longer battery life.</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 3 XL is more obviously different from its predecessor, with a large <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/why-are-android-phone-makers-embracing-the-notch/\">notch making a controversial appearance</a> at the top of the 6.3-inch OLED screen. It also retains a sizable chin below. The display sports a resolution of 2,960 x 1,440 pixels, which translates to a sharp 523 ppi. The screen is flanked by stereo front-facing speakers.</p>",
            "<p>Just like its smaller sibling, the Google Pixel 3 XL has a two-tone design on the glass back, with a fingerprint sensor in the middle and a single camera lens at the top left. It also comes in black, white with the mint green power button, and in the new pink color with an orange power button.</p>",
            "<p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor is backed up by 4GB of RAM and there\u2019s 64GB or 128GB of onboard storage, with no expansion option. You won\u2019t find a 3.5mm audio jack here, but there are USB-C earbuds in the box and support for <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/best-wireless-headphones/\">wireless headphones</a> via Bluetooth 5.0.</p>",
            "<p>The battery is rated at 3,430mAh, which is actually a touch smaller than last year\u2019s Pixel 2 XL battery, but we expect power efficiency improvements to help keep it running for a day. There\u2019s also support for Qi wireless charging and fast charging.</p>",
            "<p>The most exciting upgrades in the Google Pixel 3 and 3 XL are to be found in the camera department, and both phones have exactly the same camera setup.</p>",
            "<p>Google has stuck steadfastly with a single-lens main camera rated at 12.2 megapixels, even in the face of <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/photo-shootout-p20-pro-galaxy-s9-iphone-x-pixel-2/\">dual- and triple-lens competition</a>. We don\u2019t blame it, as the camera in the Pixel 2 and 2 XL has held its own very well over the last year \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s still our\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-camera-phones/\">reigning camera phone champion</a>. The main camera has optical image stabilization, laser autofocus, dual pixel phase detection, and support for high dynamic range (HDR).</p>",
            "<p>Google is able to squeeze such great performance out of its camera by employing some clever software trickery, instead of relying upon more hardware. The A.I.-powered camera in the Pixel 3 and 3 XL takes a burst of shots before and after you press the shutter button and then analyzes them to suggest the best options, looking for shots where subjects are looking at the camera with open eyes and smiles. It also offers an excellent portrait mode capable of blurring the background for the perfect bokeh, and it\u2019s capable of automatically tracking subjects, so you don\u2019t need to keep tapping to refocus. There\u2019s a new zoom option that allows you to zoom in, even without a telephoto lens, with A.I. filling in the gaps and bringing you the detail level you want.</p>",
            "<p>The front-facing camera features a bigger upgrade, combining an 8.1-megapixel telephoto lens with an f/1.8 aperture and a second 8.1-megapixel wide-angle lens that features an f/2.2 aperture. This combination will enable you to capture great group selfies or get more background in, and it should also perform well in low light, making it perfect for grabbing shots at night or indoors.</p>",
            "<p>Just as it did with previous Pixel phones, Google is offering free, unlimited Google Photos storage for all the full resolution photos and videos you take with the Pixel 3 or 3 XL.</p>",
            "<p>Both the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL run Android 9.0 Pie. They ditch the old home, back, and recents buttons in favor of the new gesture navigation.</p>",
            "<p>From next month, Google Assistant will be enhanced with the ability to screen spam calls, answer for you, and provide a transcription so you can decide whether to block them or call back. The new Pixels will also be the first to get the ability to make calls for you and perform tasks like making restaurant reservations.</p>",
            "<p>If you use your Pixel 3 or 3 XL with the new Pixel Stand, then you\u2019ll also get special one-touch shortcuts or voice commands to enable you to check your schedule and more.</p>",
            "<p>The Google Pixel 3 starts from $799 and the Pixel 3 XL starts at $899. If you want the higher 128GB storage capacity of either, it will cost you an extra $100. Both of the phones are available now.</p>",

            "<p>Mobile hardware is getting better and better, but when it comes to flagship smartphones, it doesn\u2019t seem to be getting any cheaper. The latest flagships from Apple and Samsung are in fact among the most expensive devices we\u2019ve ever seen, with prices for the Galaxy Note 9 and iPhone X starting at $1,000 (the newer iPhone XS is even more expensive at $1,100).</p>",
            "<p>But if it\u2019s time for a new phone, then these flagships really are the best that money can buy. If you\u2019re in the market for a new smartphone and you want one of the latest and greatest \u2013 without shelling out a grand or more \u2013 then the new Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL are fantastic options.</p>",
            "<p>Our review team sang high praise for the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-review/\">Google Pixel 3</a> and its larger sibling, the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-xl-review/\">Pixel 3 XL</a>.\u00a0 The highlights of both designs were their great build quality, beautiful OLED displays, great performance, and intuitive software, with the phones\u2019\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-pixel-cuts-through-ai-hype/\">new Google A.I.</a> being a particularly impressive feature.</p>",
            "<p>Deals are typically scarce when it comes to new devices, as you\u2019d expect from something that\u2019s just been released and hasn\u2019t even shipped yet. You can still score a deal, however, if you take advantage of pre-order bonuses like Verizon\u2019s \u201cbuy one, get one\u201d offer, which is by far the best deal going for the Google Pixel 3 right now.</p>",
            "<p>Google\u2019s partnership with Verizon means that this is the only one of the main carriers you can use with the Pixel 3, but if you\u2019re a Verizon customer or are looking to switch, then this BOGO offer lets you score a free 64GB Pixel 3 when you pre-order either the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/go/a06cac4bc1476036d5686af6df7fab0baa6c8ea2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" class=\" h-affiliate-link trackable\" data-event-type=\"affiliate-click\" data-event-action=\"manual\" data-event-param=\"Verizon\">Google Pixel 3</a>\u00a0or <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/go/261f1df9285f2a85226dc463acafbc1055a5634b/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" class=\" h-affiliate-link trackable\" data-event-type=\"affiliate-click\" data-event-action=\"manual\" data-event-param=\"Verizon\">Pixel 3 XL</a>\u00a0\u2013 effectively an $800 discount. This offer requires you to add a new line of service to your plan for at least one of the phones, and you\u2019ll have to buy both up-front with the $800 rebate coming in the form of bill credits over 24 months.</p>",
            "<p>If you really want the Google Pixel 3, but simply can\u2019t justify buying two phones to get a discount, then you also have a second option. Best Buy is offering a free $100 gift card with the pre-order of a new <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-3-64gb-just-black-verizon/6303045.p?skuId=6303045\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pixel 3</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-3-xl-64gb-just-black-verizon/6303050.p?skuId=6303050\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pixel 3 XL</a> \u2013 not a mind-blowing deal, but not bad considering the Pixel is already the cheapest of the new flagships to hit the market this fall even without any discounts.

            "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-pixel-3-news/\">Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL</a> may have stolen the show at Google\u2019s annual hardware event, but they weren\u2019t the only devices that the company unveiled. In fact, like Apple did with AirPower a little over a year ago, Google is also showing off a new wireless charger \u2014 called the Google Pixel Stand.</p>",
            "<p>The release of the Pixel Stand certainly doesn\u2019t come as a surprise. The device was leaked a few times before Google\u2019s October 9 event, so we already knew about its existence. While it may primarily serve as a wireless charging dock, it also offers more features \u2014 namely, it turns your phone into a Google Assistant screen when it\u2019s charging, offering up information you may need when you need it.</p>",
            "<p>When you dock your phone, the user interface of your device adjusts to show information that you can see at a glance. The information, as you might expect, is powered by Google Assistant \u2014 so you will be able to quickly and easily ask Assistant to find information for you, kind of like how you can on the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/google-home-hub-specs-roundup/\">new Google Home Hub</a>. On top of that, Google says you will be able to control your smart home devices while your phone is docked, and it knows your morning routine \u2014 so when you wake up, it will display information like commute times. Other features include the fact that when you dock your phone at night, it\u2019ll automatically switch to Do Not Disturb, and when it\u2019s waking you up in the morning it will display ambient light to help you wake up. During the day, you can also display an album of your favorite photos in a slideshow while your phone charges.</p>",
            "<p>For those interested in the Google Pixel Stand, it\u2019s now available for pre-order for $80 <a href=\"https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_stand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">straight from the Google Store</a>. Google didn\u2019t specifically name a date for full availability of the device, but we assume it\u2019ll follow the Pixel 3\u2019s lead and be available for purchase starting on October 18.</p>",
            "<p>Alongside the Pixel Stand, Google also announced the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-review/\">Pixel 3</a> and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-xl-review/\">Pixel 3 XL</a>, as well as the new <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/smart-home-reviews/google-home-hub-review/\">Google Home Hub</a>, a smart display that comes fully loaded with Google Assistant, and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/laptop-reviews/google-pixel-slate-review/\">Pixel Slate</a>, a Chrome OS 2-in-1.

            "<p>We\u2019ll run through some features exclusive to the Pixel line, and some that will work on any <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/android-9-pie-review/\">Android 9.0 Pie</a> phone.

Without further ado, here are our top Pixel 3 tips.</p>",
            "<p>Tap and hold on any open area of your home screen and you\u2019ll get a pop-up menu that lets you select <em>Widgets</em> and <em>Wallpapers</em> \u2013 we recommend the <em>Living Universe</em> section in <em>Wallpapers</em>, where Google offers some fantastic animated wallpapers. Some of the other categories offer a <em>Daily wallpaper</em> option that changes your wallpaper every day.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll also find <em>Home settings</em> in here, where you can decide if you want Notification dots, whether new app icons should be added to the Home screen, set <em>At A Glance</em> info like calendar events to stay at the top of the screen, and more.</p>",
            "<p>Pull down the notification shade with two fingers and tap the wee pencil icon at the bottom right to edit the quick settings toggles that appear. You can simply tap and drag icons to add or remove them and select your preferred spot.</p>",
            "<p>Because blue light can make it <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/does-blue-light-ruin-sleep-we-ask-an-expert/\">harder to fall asleep</a>, most phone manufacturers now offer a <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-use-blue-light-filter-phone/\">blue light filter</a> that can be scheduled to kick in near bedtime. On your Pixel 3, go into <em>Settings &gt; Display &gt; Night Light</em> and tap <em>Schedule,</em> where you can choose to have it turn on precisely when you want or automatically align with the sunset and sunrise in your area.</p>",
            "<p>You can also set this as a part of your <em>Wind Down</em> bedtime routine in <em>Settings &gt; Digital Wellbeing</em>.</p>",
            "<p>With 64GB of storage in the base model and no room for a Micro SD card, you might find that you run out of space on your Pixel 3 or 3 XL. Apart from uninstalling apps you don\u2019t need, you should also go to <em>Settings &gt; Storage</em> and tap <em>Free up space</em>.</p>",
            "<p>Another way to free up space is to back up photos and video to Google Photos, where you can back up everything in its original quality for free. Once everything is backed up, tap on the small hamburger menu at the top left in Google Photos and then tap <em>Settings &gt; Free up device storage</em>.</p>",
            "<p>If a call comes in that you suspect may be spam \u2014 or you just don\u2019t want to take it \u2014\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-call-screening-how-to-use/\">tap <em>Screen call</em></a>\u00a0and Google Assistant will answer for you, saying, \u201cHi, the person you\u2019re calling is using a screening service from Google, and will get a copy of this conversation. Go ahead and say your name, and why you\u2019re calling.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll see what they say transcribed in real time on your Pixel 3 screen and you can choose whether to answer, send a quick reply, or report as spam.</p>",
            "<p>To use split screen, simply swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the multitasking view showing your recent apps and tap the app icon at the top of one of the apps you want open. Then select <em>Split screen</em> and choose the second app you want open. You can drag the bar in the middle to resize, then simply drag it all the way to the top or bottom when you\u2019re done to go full screen with one of the apps.</p>",
            "<p>We definitely recommend turning Ambient Display on, so that you can see new notifications and other information on your Pixel 3\u2019s screen even when it\u2019s locked, but you should configure it. Since battery life isn\u2019t the best, we wouldn\u2019t recommend leaving it on all the time. Go to <em>Settings &gt; Display &gt; Advanced &gt; Ambient Display</em> and make sure that the\u00a0<em>Always on</em>\u00a0mode is off, but <em>New notifications</em> is on. We also turned on <em>Double-tap to check phone</em> and <em>Lift to check phone</em>, but you might feel one of those options is enough.</p>",
            "<p>You can simply double tap the power button to quickly launch the camera app at any time, even when your Pixel 3 is locked. It\u2019s a handy shortcut when you want to capture a spontaneous moment and speed is important. You can toggle this feature on and off in <em>Settings &gt; System &gt; Gestures &gt; Jump to camera</em>.</p>",
            "<p>You can use your Pixel 3\u2019s volume keys to snap photos or zoom in if you configure them. Open the camera app and swipe over to <em>More &gt; Settings</em>, then tap <em>Gestures</em> and choose your preference.</p>",
            "<p>You can also set what double tapping on the screen in the camera app should do here: Zoom in or switch cameras.</p>",
            "<p>Sometimes you\u2019ll negotiate into the perfect group selfie position and realize that the main camera is on instead of the front-facing camera. Don\u2019t worry, just twist your wrist twice and it should switch to the front-facing camera. This should be on by default, but you can find the option in <em>Settings &gt; System &gt; Gestures &gt; Flip camera</em>.</p>",

            "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-review/\">Google Pixel 3</a> and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-xl-review/\">Pixel 3 XL</a> are arguably among the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-android-phones/\">best Android phones</a> to date. They feature top-tier specs, uncluttered Android software, and all the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/5-features-we-love-and-dont-pixel-3/\">artificial intelligence</a> Google can pack in. But these devices aren\u2019t perfect. Since the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-pixel-3-news/\">Google Pixel 3 and 3 XL</a>, a few issues have cropped up \u2014 ones you may be experiencing.</p>",
            "<p>If you have run into any Pixel 3 problems, we\u2019ve put together this guide. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about Pixel 3 problems, and how to fix them.</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 3\u2019s camera is incredible, but quite a <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/im-fed-how-slow-google-pixel-3-camera\">few people are noticing</a> the camera app itself can sometimes take a while to start up. Starting the camera app on older Pixels had always been a snappy affair, so it was puzzling to see it taking a few seconds to load on the Pixel 3. We have confirmed this problem on our Pixel 3 XL, and it even extends to snapping a picture. Where there\u2019s supposed to be zero lag when you tap the shutter button, we\u2019re seeing the Pixel 3 take up to four seconds at times to actually capture the photograph. That\u2019s bad, and frustrating. We reached out to Google.</p>",
            "<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been investigating some reports of camera sluggishness,\u201d a spokesperson told Digital Trends. \u201cWe have an update for Camera rolling out in the coming weeks that should improve performance.\u201d</p>",
            "<p><strong>Fix:</strong></p>",
            "<p>Have you noticed text messages on your Pixel device disappearing? You\u2019re not going crazy. According to a <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/11/14/pixel-3-users-noticed-text-messages-vanishing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report from Android Police</a>, the latest Pixel 3 security update is causing some text messages to disappear on some devices.</p>",
            "<p>Google has acknowledged the problem quickly, and promised a fix would be rolling out soon. However, that was back in November 2018, and it seems users are still waiting, with <a href=\"https://support.google.com/messages/thread/886627?hl=en\">one complaint</a> coming in on December 31.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Fix:\u00a0</strong></p>",
            "<p>This is an issue that effects anyone charging with a non-Google-branded wireless charger. Because of the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-pixel-3-wont-wirelessly-charge-at-max-speed-except-1829955945\">weird way</a> Google has set up its wireless charging, it\u2019s not possible to access fast 10W wireless charging on any pad that hasn\u2019t been made by Google. However, the Pixel 3 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NexusBen/status/1054914152119103488\">still displays</a> a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/9pkxsu/pixel_3_xl_wireless_charging/\">\u201cCharging Rapidly\u201d</a> message \u2014 even when charging using the slower 5W speeds. It\u2019s not the biggest problem in the world, but it can be annoying if you don\u2019t know about it.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>",
            "<p>Some people have reported that\u00a0opening the camera app while listening to music seems to cause the music app to close in the background, stopping the playback of the music.\u00a0This is <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2018/10/22/pixel-3-memory-management-issue-background-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">another bug</a> that seems to be related to memory management on the Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. We were able to replicate the problem, both with Spotify and with Google\u2019s own YouTube Music.</p>",
            "<p>Because the issue seems to be related to memory handling, it\u2019s very likely we\u2019ll see a software update fixing the issue in the near future. It\u2019s possible the issue is actually the same problem causing photos not to save \u2014 and that it all comes down to issues with the Pixel 3 not handling its 4GB of memory well enough. While the fix wasn\u2019t included in November\u2019s patch for the Pixel 3, it was included <a href=\"https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/pixel/2018-12-01\">in December\u2019s</a>.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>",
            "<p>The Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL are Verizon-exclusive phones, basically meaning that Verizon is the only carrier in the U.S. with the right to sell the phones. Some owners, however, have reported that the Pixel 3 from Best Buy was also locked to the Verizon network, meaning users couldn\u2019t buy the phone and activate it on another network. Once the phone was activated on Verizon, it was then unlocked \u2014 meaning you could only then use it on another network.</p>",
            "<p>Thankfully, it seems as though Verizon has, at least temporarily, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/19/18001736/verizon-google-pixel-3-unlocked-carriers-activation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unlocked the Pixel 3</a> completely. The unlocking was sent to Pixel 3 phones through a software update \u2014 so you should be able to set up your phone without a SIM card, update it, then activate it on whatever network you choose.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Potential solution:</strong></p>",
            "<p>A number of users have reported that after taking a photo with the camera app, those photos aren\u2019t saving \u2014 essentially meaning that the photo could be gone forever. That\u2019s a pretty major problem, and one that seems to be pretty widespread too \u2014 a number of <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/9pbk6z/google_still_hasnt_fixed_the_issue_of_photos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">users on Reddit</a> have reported running into it. The issue, in particular, seems to come up when you take a photo with the Google Camera app, then switch to another app or lock the phone immediately after taking the photo. In some situations, the photo will eventually appear again in the gallery, but that doesn\u2019t seem to happen all the time.</p>",
            "<p>The issue seems to be related to how the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL handle memory, and quitting out before the HDR processing is finished. Thankfully, this means that it can be fixed with a software update. It wasn\u2019t included in November\u2019s patch, which was a shame \u2014 but it was supposed fixed in <a href=\"https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/pixel/2018-12-01\">December\u2019s update</a>.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>",

            "<p>Google\u2019s new smartphones <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-pixel-3-news/\">are finally here</a>. Following months of leaks, the company officially announced the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-review/\">Pixel 3</a> and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-xl-review/\">Pixel 3 XL</a> at its hardware event in New York City on October 9. The successor to the Pixel 2 brings along new artificial intelligence features, updated camera software, wireless charging capabilities, and more.</p>",
            "<p>While Google\u2019s new smartphones offer plenty of things to be excited about, there are also additions we aren\u2019t fans of. Here are five features we love about the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, and five that we don\u2019t.</p>",
            "<p>As opposed to last year, the Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL come with the ability to be charged wirelessly. To charge the devices, Google released its own wireless charging pad \u2014 the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-pixel-stand-news/\">Pixel Stand</a>\u00a0\u2014 which comes with an 18-watt fast charger. Google says you can get seven hours of use after only 15 minutes of charging.</p>",
            "<p>The minute you place your Pixel 3 on the stand, you\u2019ll also have access to Google Assistant,with shortcuts that appear on the display. It\u2019ll also work similar to your Google Home \u2014 every morning, your Pixel 3 display will slowly brighten to gently wake you up and will then provide you with your morning routine.</p>",
            "<p>When you\u2019re not using your Pixel 3 while it\u2019s on the Pixel Stand, it won\u2019t just sit there and charge. You\u2019ll be able to turn your smartphone into a digital photo frame, allowing it to display all of your photos in a slideshow. When you\u2019re listening to music, it\u2019ll also display the music and cover art on the display.</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL each feature dual front-facing speakers. This time around, the speakers are 40 percent louder than those included on its predecessors \u2014 which should provide a bigger and richer sound. Both smartphones will also ship with six months of YouTube Music for free.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s no secret that the Pixel 2 offers impressive front-facing and rear-facing cameras that take stunning shots. The Pixel 3 is no different \u2014\u00a0 Google has added a ton of new features for an even better photo-taking experience.</p>",
            "<p>For starters, there\u2019s Top Shot, which will help during those unexpected moments that can ruin a perfect shot \u2014 whether it\u2019s a blink or a sneeze. The feature automatically captures a burst of shots in HDR Plus, giving you an array of alternate photos to choose from. Google also introduced Super res zoom, which uses artificial intelligence to provide you with sharp photos when you zoom in on a subject.</p>",
            "<p>Those who find themselves frustrated with the image quality of photos taken in low light will be happy to know athat the Pixel 3 will include Night Sight later this year. Whether you\u2019re at a dimly lit restaurant or camping with friends at night, the smartphone uses machine learning to take natural-looking photos without having to turn on the flash.</p>",
            "<p>We also love the wid- angle camera on the front of the Pixel 3, which allows users to take even better selfies. With Group Selfie, you\u2019ll be able to capture 184 percent more room in your photo. There\u2019s also Photobooth mode that automatically snaps photos when it recognizes you\u2019re smiling or making another expression.</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 3 now includes Gmail\u2019s Smart Compose, which automatically suggests phrases to use within emails, depending on the context, to help you write your emails faster. There\u2019s also Gboard built into the device, which will recommend things like stickers and GIFs to use while texting.</p>",
            "<p>Google\u2019s new smartphone also includes <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-screen-time-and-google-digital-wellbeing/\">Digital Wellbeing</a>, which was introduced with the launch of Android P. You\u2019ll be able to see how much time you\u2019re spending on your phone and can set different time limits on specific apps. There\u2019s also a new feature that will allow you to turn on Do Not Disturb mode by simply flipping your Pixel 3 over \u2014 which will mute notifications or rings.</p>",
            "<p>We all know how annoying it is to receive tons of phone calls from unknown numbers, only to pick up and realize it\u2019s a telemarketer. That\u2019s why we love that the Pixel 3 can answer for you instead. When you tap the \u201cScreen Call\u201d button, it will answer for you and ask who is calling and why. The conversation will then be transcribed in real time on your display, so that you can choose if you\u2019d like to pick up. You also have the option of marking it as spam, asking for more information, or choosing to call back later. The feature will be available on the Pixel 3 in the U.S. right out of the box.</p>",
            "<p>After a full year of smartphone manufacturers <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/why-are-android-phone-makers-embracing-the-notch/\">adopting the notch design</a> that was first made popular by Apple\u2019s iPhone X, Google has jumped on the bandwagon as well. As with any trend, the novelty soon wears off and the design starts to feel overdone \u2014 which is why we were disappointed to see the Pixel 3 XL feature the notch at the top of the display.</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 3 and 3 XL feature 2,915 mAh and 3,430 mAh batteries, respectively, but we wish both phones had bigger batteries. We\u2019d like them to last beyond a day before needing a charge. While the Pixel 3 has a bigger battery than the Pixel 2, the Pixel 3 XL actually has a slightly smaller battery than the Pixel 2 XL, though the new, more efficient processor should allow for longer battery life in the new phones. Either way, we expect to get about a full day\u2019s worth of battery life \u2014 at most \u2014 with the batteries in the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL.</p>",
            "<p>Pricing for the Pixel 3 is a bit high, starting at $800, while the 3 XL is $900 \u2014 both phones are more expensive than last year\u2019s Pixels. If you want the 128GB storage capacity, you\u2019ll have to put down an extra $100. While it does come with a few more capabilities and a slightly tweaked design, it doesn\u2019t offer any dramatically new features (like a Face ID-esque unlocking system) that warrant the Pixel 3\u2019s $150 jump in price over last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-2-review/\">Pixel 2</a>. We would\u2019ve liked for the new smartphones to stay similarly priced to last year\u2019s models.</p>",
            "<p>Even with the third iteration of the device, Google has yet to change the overall design of the Pixel. As with its predecessors, the Pixel 3 includes a matte finish and two-tone design with a fingerprint sensor in the middle, along with a camera lens in the top left. The only two major design changes are the notch (as mentioned before) and the fact that Google has gone with an all glass back \u2014 but we do like that it still feels like a matte finish, but isn\u2019t as slippery as its predecessor. If it weren\u2019t for the notch and new color variants, it\u2019d be tough to tell the difference between the new Pixel phones and the ones that came before. They have price tags to match the top flagships, but the new Pixels don\u2019t really look or feel like premium flagship phones.</p>",
            "<p>Even though we weren\u2019t expecting it, we were definitely secretly hoping for the return of the headphone jack. Google made it clear with the Pixel 2 that it was completely doing away with it, shipping a USB-C-to 3.5mm adapter with the phone instead. But this time around, the Pixel 3 comes equipped with USB-C Pixel headphones that you can use, which also allows you to talk to Google Assistant.</p>"

            "<p>The Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL may be the current stock Android kings, but not everyone has $650 or more to spend on a phone. Those who don\u2019t could previously have purchased the last-generation <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-review/\">Google Pixel</a>, which is still a very nice phone in its own right. Now, however, that option is gone \u2014 Google has removed the device from its online store.</p>",
            "<p>Not only does the phone seem to be out of stock, but it\u2019s been completely removed from the store. If you hit a link to the Google Pixel on the Google Store, you\u2019ll be redirected to a generic <a href=\"https://store.google.com/category/phones?srp=/product/pixel_phone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">landing page</a> for the Pixel lineup \u2014 which only shows the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-pixel-2/\">Google Pixel\u00a02</a>\u00a0and related accessories.\u00a0Google confirmed directly to Digital Trends that the Google Pixel and Pixel XL will no longer be available from the Google Store.</p>",
            "<p>It does somewhat make sense, even if it\u2019s a little disappointing. Google probably wasn\u2019t selling all that many Pixel units at this point, especially considering the fact that it only gave it a discount of around $100 when the Pixel 2 came out. Users that want a cheaper stock Android device can still turn to the likes of eBay, where the phone comes a lot cheaper. Some third-party retailers are also still selling the phone, though we\u2019re not sure how much longer that will last. Currently, Amazon is selling both new and refurbished versions of the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL</p>",
            "<p>Of course, there are plenty of rumors that the move is more to make room for a new generation of Pixel devices than anything else. We expect the Pixel 3 to launch sometime around October, which is when the first Pixel and the Pixel 2 launched. This time around, however, Google is rumored to be working on three Pixel devices, one of which will likely be a more midrange device aimed at those who want a stock Android phone from Google but don\u2019t want to spend the ton of cash needed for the flagship device.</p>",
            "<p>When the Google Pixel was launched, it marked a change for Google, which wasn\u2019t previously really a hardware manufacturer. Since then, the company has seriously begun embracing hardware, not just through phones, but also with the Pixelbook laptop, Pixel Buds, and more.</p>"

Rumors say Google is working on the Pixel 3 Lite and Pixel 3 Lite XL, two budget options for those who want a Google smartphone experience, but don\u2019t want to pony up the cash for <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-pixel-3-news/\">the Pixel 3 or Pixel 3 XL</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Here\u2019s what we know about them so far.</p>",
            "<p>Should we expect the Pixel 3 Lite range to be much less powerful than the Pixel 3 range? That seems the most likely outcome \u2014 but how much of a downgrade could we expect?</p>",
            "<p>The latest leaks come from <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/11630546\">a Geekbench score</a> which claims to be for the Pixel 3 XL Lite, equipped with a Snapdragon 710 \u2014 largely in line with previous rumors that the larger Lite phone would come with this processor. It\u2019s likely the small Pixel 3 Lite will be equipped with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 670 processor, which has so far been largely featured in phones targeted at Asian markets.</p>",
            "<p>RAM numbers are high even on midrange phones these days, and the same Geekbench results show the Pixel 3 XL Lite to come with 6GB of RAM. We expect there to be other configurations available, and wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see both models start at 4GB. There\u2019s no mention of storage space, but 64GB seems likely. Most other midrange phones would come with a MicroSD card slot to boost storage, but <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/12/09/google-pixel-3-lite-and-pixel-3-lite-xl-appear-in-new-leak/\">sources have noted</a>\u00a0the apparent lack of such a slot.</p>",
            "<p>On the back, there\u2019s a 12-megapixel camera, while the front of the device has an 8-megapixel front-facing camera. Powering it all is a 2,915mAh battery.</p>",
            "<p>With a name like Lite, you\u2019d expect to pay a little less for these Pixel phones than the regular Pixel phones. The leaks so far indicate the phones will end up costing between $400 and $500, several hundred dollars less than the regular Pixel phones.</p>",
            "<p>When will they be released, and where? Google has potentially signed up with Verizon to launch the Pixel 3 Lite and Pixel 3 Lite XL sometime in the spring this year, according to sources speaking to <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/12/27/source-google-will-launch-the-pixel-3-and-3-xl-lite-on-verizon-in-spring-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Android Police</a>. It was speculated early on the Lite Pixel phones would not be sold in the U.S., and would instead head to other markets including India, China, and Russia. A Verizon deal would obviously make this assumption false.</p>",
            "<p>Will the Lite Pixels look the same as the Pixel 3 and 3 XL? In this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO9eW1SRQAM\">video</a> posted by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWJedqvdP2gB2f3qaJCO05g\">91Mobiles</a>, both the Pixel 3 Lite and Pixel 3 XL Lite are apparently shown in a full 360-degree render. It states the display sizes for both phones will be 5.5 inches and 6 inches, as well as some other details like the plastic body and return of the 3.5mm headphone jack. Interestingly, it seems the Pixel 3 Lite XL lacks its bigger brother\u2019s divisive notch.</p>",
            "<p>The first indication of a Pixel 3 Lite was <a href=\"https://rozetked.me/articles/3751-eksklyuziv-pixel-3-lite-sargo-v-nashih-rukah-s-jack-3-5-i-snapdragon-670\" rel=\"noopener\">leaked online by Russian tech blogger Rozetked</a>, who posted a hands-on video of an unreleased Pixel 3. The Pixel 3 Lite sports a similar style to the Pixel 3, but only has a display resolution of 2220 x 1080. It also appears to have a headphone jack, unlike the other two Pixel 3 devices, and a slightly thicker polycarbonate build.</p>",
            "<p>When you buy a Pixel phone, you expect <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-camera-phones/\">a great camera</a>. so how about the Pixel 3 Lite? Rumors claim the Pixel 3 Lite has the same 12.2-megapixel camera sensor as its flagship siblings, and if it does, that\u2019s a huge selling point for the phone. The photo samples you see here are apparently those taken with the Pixel 3 Lite.</p>",

Here\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/what-to-expect-from-google-october-event-2018/\">what we expect from Google at its October 9 New York event</a>.</p>",
            "<p>The event starts at 11 a.m. ET on October 9 \u2014 that\u2019s 8 a.m. PT if you\u2019re on the West Coast, or 3 p.m. GMT for our U.K.-based readers.</p>",

            "<p>Perhaps the easiest way to watch the event is straight from the Made by Google YouTube channel, which will livestream the event once it begins. Through YouTube, you can watch the event on any phone and any computer without the need for an extra app, which makes it one of the easier ways to watch Google unveil its new products.</p>",
            "<p>The YouTube stream is scheduled to start around 20 minutes before the event \u2014 though if you do log on at 11 a.m. ET on the dot, we don\u2019t think you\u2019ll miss much besides pre-event music and perhaps a few ads.</p>",

            "<p>As Apple did for its last event, Google will also be livestreaming on Twitter \u2014 so if you prefer to use the Twitter app for livestreaming, then you\u2019re in luck. Unlike the YouTube stream, the Twitter stream is scheduled to start at 11 a.m. There may be a benefit to watching on Twitter if you\u2019re interested in seeing what others think of the new products \u2014 live tweets related to the event will appear below the livestream.</p>",
