            "<p>The legal tug of war between Apple and Qualcomm continued this week with what at first may have seemed like a rare win for the chip giant in a Chinese court.</p>",
            "<p>After Qualcomm alleged that features in iOS violated a number of its patents, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-apple/qualcomm-wins-import-ban-against-several-apple-iphones-in-china-idUSKBN1O91LD?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-apple/qualcomm-wins-import-ban-against-several-apple-iphones-in-china-idUSKBN1O91LD?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social', {metric25:1})\">Chinese courts on Monday granted a temporary injunction on the sale</a> of a number of iPhone models, a move that prompted an <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/10/apple-files-appeal-to-overturn-iphone-sales-ban-in-china.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/10/apple-files-appeal-to-overturn-iphone-sales-ban-in-china.html', {metric25:1})\">immediate appeal from Apple.</a><br></p>",
            "<p>The patents in question concern the way Apple resizes and formats images in iOS and how the operating system handles switching between various touchscreen apps. The court\u2019s recent injunction bans the sale of iPhones from the iPhone 6s to the iPhone X. However, the ban does not mention any restrictions on the sale of the new iPhone XS, XS Max, or iPhone XR, and Apple says that up-to-date versions of iOS do not include any infringing software.</p>",
            "<p>Despite Apple\u2019s claims that it has updated its software to remove any infringing software from its mobile OS, the company still filed an appeal against the injunction while also releasing a statement saying, \u201cQualcomm\u2019s effort to ban our products is another desperate move by a company whose illegal practices are under investigation by regulators around the world,\u201d with the latter accusation referencing Apple\u2019s belief that Qualcomm holds a monopoly on numerous critical wireless networking patents, and that Qualcomm charges too much money for third-parties to license those patents. </p>",
            "<p>\u201cAll iPhone models remain available for our customers in China,\u201d Apple added. \u201cQualcomm is asserting three patents they had never raised before, including one which has already been invalidated. We will pursue all our legal options through the courts.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>From Qualcomm\u2019s perspective, the big issue is the belief that <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-owes-7-billion-in-royalty-payments-qualcomm-claims/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-owes-7-billion-in-royalty-payments-qualcomm-claims/', {metric25:1})\">Apple owes Qualcomm upwards of $7 billion in patent royalties and licensing fees</a>. Previously, Apple paid a fee for licensing Qualcomm\u2019s tech on top of a flat fee for every device sold, but last year Apple stopped paying those fees, saying Qualcomm\u2019s model was abusive and potentially illegal. </p>",
            "<p>So for now, not much if anything is changing. Apple is going to continue right on selling iPhones while Qualcomm continues to tally up damages, and in the background, both companies\u2019 legal teams will continue looking for more ticky-tacky shit they can use to drag each other to court. </p>",
            "<p>Sometime in the future, this might all get sorted out, but based on today\u2019s developments, that day is not today. </p>"

And then, a clever group of people will realize that you can still buy the iPhone X\u2014which is seemingly identical to the iPhone XS\u2014<a href=\"https://www.verizonwireless.com/smartphones/apple-iphone-x/#sku=sku2680533\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.verizonwireless.com/smartphones/apple-iphone-x/#sku=sku2680533', {metric25:1})\">for $900</a>, which is just $150 more than the XR. But still, a lot of people will decide the iPhone XR is good enough.</p>",
            "<p>Before we get deeper into the details of the new phones, let\u2019s agree on one thing: buying a new iPhone is a lot more complicated than it used to be. It used to be there was one iPhone, it cost $500, or you could spend another $100 for more storage. Now, Apple has made the iPhone lineup so crowded that the difference between the cheapest and most expensive models is $1,000. The thriftiest choice is a 32GB iPhone 7 <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-7', {metric25:1})\">at $450</a>. The speediest is an iPhone XS Max with 512GB of storage <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-xs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-xs', {metric25:1})\">for $1,450</a>. The spread gets even more extreme when you consider the fact that you can still buy earlier iPhone models through resellers. A 16GB iPhone 6 can be yours <a rel=\"nofollow\" data-amazonasin=\"B00YD547Q6\" data-amazonsubtag=\"[t|link[p|1829996656[a|B00YD547Q6[au|452356546[b|gizmodo[lt|text\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Commerce', 'gizmodo - The Tricky Economics of the iPhone XS and the iPhone XR', 'B00YD547Q6');window.ga('unique.send', 'event', 'Commerce', 'gizmodo - The Tricky Economics of the iPhone XS and the iPhone XR', 'B00YD547Q6');\" data-amazontag=\"gizmodoamzn-20\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-GSM-Unlocked-16GB/dp/B00YD547Q6/ref=lp_12522859011_1_1?s=wireless&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1540482187&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=gizmodoamzn-20&amp;ascsubtag=624075f1f8b44f4fafb58bac7bc4f891f38d5beb\">for just $170</a> through Amazon.</p>",
            "<p>To make things a little more complicated, there are several payment plan options. Some people certainly prefer to pay the full price for their new iPhone upfront, but the payment plans offered by wireless carriers as well as Apple are appealing. Verizon and AT&amp;T <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/how-to-upgrade-to-an-iphone-7-without-getting-ripped-of-1786255847\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/how-to-upgrade-to-an-iphone-7-without-getting-ripped-of-1786255847', {metric25:1})\">both offer relatively straightforward options</a> to get a zero-interest loan for the price of your device that you pay off over the course of two years, insurance not included, and when you\u2019ve made all the payments, you own the phone. You also have the option to upgrade to a new model after one year. The Apple Upgrade Program is basically the same thing except you have to pay for AppleCare, which makes the monthly payments slightly higher. Nevertheless, a lot of people are going to be looking at the difference between those monthly payments when deciding which phone to buy.</p>",
            "<p>That in mind, the cheapest iPhone XR will cost you $37.41 per month through the Apple Upgrade Program. That number drops to $31.24 per month if you get the carrier payment plan. The cheapest iPhone XS will cost you $49.91 per month through the Apple Upgrade Program and $41.66 through a carrier.</p>",
            "<p>So, even though there\u2019s a $250 in the price of the phones themselves, you\u2019re looking at a difference of about $12 a month if you do a payment plan. This is not to say that paying with installments is the best path forward for your financial health. However, you\u2019re not paying any interest in doing so, and you will own the phone after you\u2019ve made all the payments. If you miss payments or pay late, you\u2019ll get hit with fees, and that will make everything more expensive.</p>",
            "<p>The iPhone XS <em>is</em> the more expensive device, but you\u2019re also getting more for your money. While the XR has a lower-contrast LCD display, the XS comes with a fancy OLED display. <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-xr-is-apples-new-real-big-deal-1829912968\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-xr-is-apples-new-real-big-deal-1829912968', {metric25:1})\">You can see the difference</a> when you hold the two phones side-by-side. The other major difference is in the camera systems. The XR only has one camera so it lacks optical zoom and comes with a watered-down Portrait Mode. The XR also sports a lighter, cheaper-feeling aluminum case, while the XS is made of stainless steel. Perhaps because of this, the XR <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-xr-is-apples-new-real-big-deal-1829912968\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-xr-is-apples-new-real-big-deal-1829912968', {metric25:1})\">felt a little bit top-heavy</a> in our tests, as if the camera unit were weighing down one end of the device.</p>",
            "<p>Still, both the XR and the XS feature Face ID. Both use Apple\u2019s newest and most powerful A12 Bionic chip. Both look like new iPhones and might impress your friends at upcoming holiday parties. Do the differences and similarities stack up to $250 worth of value? Or $12 a month if you want to measure it that way?</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s hard to say. The next few years will really decide whether the iPhone XR or the iPhone XS is the better value. As different (or similar) as the specs may be, it will take time to see how well the devices hold up to daily use. One might expect, for instance, that the flimsy-seeming aluminum case on the iPhone XR might suffer the same problem with nicks and scratches <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/5963445/the-iphone-5-damage-report-two-months-later\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/5963445/the-iphone-5-damage-report-two-months-later', {metric25:1})\">as the aluminum case on the iPhone 5</a>. We did predict that the iPhone XS would be the first Apple phone <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-xs-is-forever-1829305262\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-xs-is-forever-1829305262', {metric25:1})\">that you could happily use for five years</a>. The iPhone XR just doesn\u2019t feel as tough or sturdy.</p>",
            "<p>The other thing that\u2019s hard to know is resale value. Demand will eventually decide how well these devices fare on the resale market, but we do know that the iPhone X has held its value to a respectable degree. Even after the new phones were announced, the resale site Gazelle <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/whats-my-used-iphone-worth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.imore.com/whats-my-used-iphone-worth', {metric25:1})\">predicted</a> that a 64GB iPhone would sell for $800 to $820. That\u2019s pretty remarkable considering the fact that a new iPhone X retails for $900, and it also suggests that the iPhone XS will also hold its value.</p>",
            "<p>At the end of the day, any buying decision is a personal one. You know your own budget, and you know your preferences. And while they do look similar on paper, the iPhone XR and the iPhone XS are different enough that it\u2019s worth going to a store and holding them both to see which one feels right. Also, don\u2019t forget that you\u2019ve never had so much choice when it comes to buying an iPhone. If you don\u2019t want Face ID or a big screen, you can still buy a brand new  iPhone 7 or an iPhone 8. Some of them <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/maybe-you-should-just-buy-an-old-iphone-1829041241#_ga=2.48732719.80129596.1540211252-2135808592.1525885870\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/maybe-you-should-just-buy-an-old-iphone-1829041241#_ga=2.48732719.80129596.1540211252-2135808592.1525885870', {metric25:1})\">are super cheap, too</a>! But if you really need that iPhone X experience, good luck deciding. And if all else fails, switch to Android.</p>"

            "<p>Lording atop its portfolio like some kind of $1,000 crown jewel, the iPhone is undoubtedly the Apple\u2019s most important product. And for years, people have droned on about how the phone that Jobs built is the most innovative and user-friendly device out there. But is it really?</p>",
            "<p>There\u2019s no doubt Apple builds excellent hardware, and the sheer existence of Apple\u2019s homegrown mobile OS years after competitors like Windows Mobile and Mozilla\u2019s Firefox OX is a testament to iOS\u2019 success. But more than ever, the decisions that go into improving the iPhone seem at odds with how people actually want to use the device. Here\u2019s a rundown of all the annoyances iPhone users have had to put up with in 2018.</p>",
            "<p>The frustration train has been building on for a few years now. According to the company, it took great \u201ccourage\u201d to eliminate the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, but really, it just got rid of a universally accepted I/O standard in an effort to get people to pony up for AirPods, the only wireless headphones you could count on to work seamlessly with the iPhone. Emboldened by Apple\u2019s \u201ccourage,\u201d competitors were content to follow Apple\u2019s lead, turning what would have otherwise been a singular screwup into an industry-wide plague on the category.</p>",
            "<p>Then last year, Apple took away people\u2019s home buttons and replaced them with a big fat notch that basically does two things: unlocks your phone with your face, and <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/apples-creepy-new-emoji-are-a-gateway-drug-to-furrydom-1804391824#_ga=2.41450468.73363231.1545052280-2135808592.1525885870\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/apples-creepy-new-emoji-are-a-gateway-drug-to-furrydom-1804391824#_ga=2.41450468.73363231.1545052280-2135808592.1525885870', {metric25:1})\">turns you into a furry</a> that\u2019s not quite ready to yiff.</p>",
            "<p>That brings us to 2018 when Apple had the gall to take the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/iphone-x-six-months-later-1825722111\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/iphone-x-six-months-later-1825722111', {metric25:1})\">iPhone X</a>\u2019s $1,000 price tag and bump it up to $1,100 for this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/iphone-xs-max-first-impressions-just-how-jumbo-is-this-1828999615\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/iphone-xs-max-first-impressions-just-how-jumbo-is-this-1828999615', {metric25:1})\">iPhone XS Max</a>. When compared to a $900 Galaxy Note 9, that $1,100 price tag seems outrageous as the Note 9 features a screen that\u2019s essentially the same size (with a higher resolution), double the base storage, a microSD card slot, and an included stylus.</p>",
            "<p>So what else actually got improved? The iPhone XS\u2019 pictures are a little better, but still not as good as what you get from a <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/google-pixel-3-review-the-other-way-to-make-a-killer-p-1829749807\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/google-pixel-3-review-the-other-way-to-make-a-killer-p-1829749807', {metric25:1})\">Pixel 3</a>, and it doesn\u2019t have the bounty of cameras you get on other flagships like the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-20-pro-is-a-technical-marvel-1830346004\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-20-pro-is-a-technical-marvel-1830346004', {metric25:1})\">Mate 20 Pro</a> or <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/lgs-5-camera-phone-offers-a-snapshot-of-the-incredible-1829488124\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/lgs-5-camera-phone-offers-a-snapshot-of-the-incredible-1829488124', {metric25:1})\">LG V40.</a> </p>",
            "<p>Thanks to Apple\u2019s new A12 Bionic chip (which is a powerhouse of a mobile chip), the new iPhones are faster too. But honestly, has anyone in the last few years <em>ever</em> complained about their new iPhone feeling slow? So what\u2019s left? More durable glass and slightly faster Face ID unlocking? It\u2019s a good thing Apple took the original iPhone X off shelves after just a year. Otherwise, there\u2019d be very little reason to buy an XS unless you absolutely need to have the 6.5-inch screen on the XS Max.</p>",
            "<p>Even with all that, Apple somehow still found a way to be cheap as hell because, <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/apple-may-finally-give-iphones-fast-charging-at-no-extr-1826225823#_ga=2.138818421.73363231.1545052280-2135808592.1525885870\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/apple-may-finally-give-iphones-fast-charging-at-no-extr-1826225823#_ga=2.138818421.73363231.1545052280-2135808592.1525885870', {metric25:1})\">despite hopeful rumors to the contrary</a>, Apple didn\u2019t upgrade the power brick that comes included with new iPhones.

            "<p>While we\u2019re at it, with the new <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-new-ipad-pro-is-the-last-great-tablet-1830380453#_ga=2.138818421.73363231.1545052280-2135808592.1525885870\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-new-ipad-pro-is-the-last-great-tablet-1830380453#_ga=2.138818421.73363231.1545052280-2135808592.1525885870', {metric25:1})\">iPad Pros recently switching over to USB-C</a>, Apple\u2019s continued support for the Lightning connector on the iPhone has become even more appalling. The new iPads have USB-C, and so do new Mac computers, but if you want to connect an iPhone to either of them, now you need a different wire. Why does asking for one cable that works with everything have to feel like summoning hellspawn?</p>",
            "<p>Then there\u2019s the<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-xr-is-apples-new-real-big-deal-1829912968\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-xr-is-apples-new-real-big-deal-1829912968', {metric25:1})\"> iPhone XR</a>, Apple\u2019s supposed \u201caffordable\u201d iPhone, which starting at $750, costs $125 more than a Galaxy S9 and features what Apple calls the most advanced LCD in the industry. Dog, for real? The iPhone XR\u2019s screen resolution is 1792 x 828, which doesn\u2019t even qualify as full HD. Also, when you spread those pixels across a 6.1-inch screen, you start to run into PPI issues because unless you have bad eyesight, you can actually see individual pixels from more than 6-inches away. There\u2019s nothing special at all about the XR\u2019s screen.</p>",
            "<p>What\u2019s worse is that if you want anything that even remotely resembles something cheap, your only option is to buy older iPhone models. It\u2019s like Apple doesn\u2019t care about people who don\u2019t have the better part of a grand to spend on a new handset.</p>",
            "<p>Where things get really annoying is when you combine all of Apple\u2019s 2018 decisions with its Fort Knox-like ecosystem, because for a company that\u2019s so invested in tech, trying to tweak your device often feels like trying to argue with the government. Want to change the way your icons look? Nope. How about customizing your theme? Hell no. You can\u2019t even install any app that doesn\u2019t come from the Almighty App store without basically needing to be a developer with a Test Flight account. In a lot of ways, Apple has become the gadget company for people who don\u2019t care about tech.</p>",
            "<p>Apple\u2019s focus on delivering a simple user experience has resulted in a phone that\u2019s tighter than Zuck\u2019s face while getting grilled by Congress.

It\u2019s the closest thing the tech world has to Stockholm syndrome, where your captor is also your savior, holding you hostage with the threat of taking away your iMessages or App Store purchases if you ever even think about switching to Android.</p>",

Or do, and end up like an Ohio man who claims his three-week-old iPhone XS Max <a href=\"https://www.idropnews.com/news/iphone/exclusive-ohio-man-asserts-iphone-xs-max-exploded-in-his-pocket-photos/90418/?_ga=2.143571957.1558506958.1546272704-1392193195.1546272704\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.idropnews.com/news/iphone/exclusive-ohio-man-asserts-iphone-xs-max-exploded-in-his-pocket-photos/90418/?_ga=2.143571957.1558506958.1546272704-1392193195.1546272704', {metric25:1})\">exploded and set his rear ablaze</a>.</p>",
            "<p>The man, who only wishes to be known as J. Hillard, told iDrop News that he noticed a strange smell coming from his phone in his rear pants pocket, followed by heat, and a burning sensation on his skin. \u201cLeft no other option, I had to exit the room since there was a female in the break room with me and remove my pants,\u201d Hillard told iDrop News. \u201cI ran to the boardroom where I got my shoes and pants off as fast as possible. A VP of our company put the fire out with a fire extinguisher because he heard me yelling.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>While it\u2019s fair to say \u201cexpensive smartphones shouldn\u2019t explode,\u201d you should also learn from Hillard\u2019s example and not sit on your phone. These batteries are sensitive to overheating, your butt is warm, and sitting on them can exert pressure that isn\u2019t good for the battery. Hillard isn\u2019t even the first dude to deal with a phone exploding on his butt. There\u2019s this <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/10/03/iphone-explodes-and-catches-fire-in-a-students-back-pocket/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://nypost.com/2016/10/03/iphone-explodes-and-catches-fire-in-a-students-back-pocket/', {metric25:1})\">student</a> whose phone blew up during gym class, and this <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/national/man-suffers-second-degree-burns-when-iphone-explodes-pocket/grSL3frOd4vtNbV9eNlHeN/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.ajc.com/news/national/man-suffers-second-degree-burns-when-iphone-explodes-pocket/grSL3frOd4vtNbV9eNlHeN/', {metric25:1})\">Seattle man</a>. What did they all have in common? They\u2019re men who put their phones in their rear pockets.</p>",
            "<p>Which brings us to realization of the one thing women\u2019s jeans are good for: You can stick a smartphone in a rear pocket AND not end up sitting on it. Women\u2019s back jean pockets are situated so high up as to be on the lower back, rather than actual butt. Whereas men can boast ample front and rear pockets in their pants, women\u2019s jeans generally only have two <em>useful</em> ones in the back. (The front ones are glorified denim mittens that you can only stick three fingers, knuckle deep in.)</p>",
            "<p>And even if we wanted to, women can\u2019t stick these increasingly ginormous phones in the front pocket. They\u2019re so shallow, phones just slide out and clatter onto the floor anytime you sit. This <a href=\"https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/', {metric25:1})\">handy visual</a> by The Pudding shows just how only 40 percent of women\u2019s front pockets can fit an iPhone X, while 100 percent of men\u2019s front pockets can. The number falls to 20 percent for the Samsung Galaxy, and just 5 percent for the Google Pixel.</p>",
            "<p>So really, this PSA is for men. Make use of your roomy front pockets. Stop putting phones in your rear pocket unless you want the VP of your company to extinguish your flaming butt.

            "<p>Another day, another Apple lawsuit.</p>",
            "<p>A freshly filed lawsuit is taking aim at Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/apple-magically-makes-the-notch-disappear-1829056511\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/apple-magically-makes-the-notch-disappear-1829056511', {metric25:1})\">questionable marketing</a> of its iPhone X, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max by claiming, among other things, that the company misled its consumers about display specs and pixel counts as well as obscured the notch on its newer phones with deceptive wallpapers. In the suit filed in the Northern District of California on Friday, two plaintiffs allege that the phones are not, in fact, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/iphone-xs/display/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.apple.com/iphone-xs/display/', {metric25:1})\">all screen</a>\u201d as advertised.</p>",
            "<p>\u201cThe screen size deception is simply based on Apple cutting corners \u2014 Defendant rounds off the corners of the Products\u2019 screens and the Products have notches without pixels at the top of their screens, but Defendant calculates the screen size of the Products by including non-screen areas such as the corners and the cut-out notch at the top of the screen,\u201d the <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/395721345/Apple-Lawsuit#from_embed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.scribd.com/document/395721345/Apple-Lawsuit#from_embed', {metric25:1})\">lawsuit states</a>. \u201cThe missing screen areas also reduce the false pixel counts of the Products\u2019 screens below their advertised pixel counts.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>By not accounting for those clipped corners and notch cut-outs, Apple misrepresented displays by \u201cabout 1/16 of an inch,\u201d the suit claims. The lawsuit also states that one of the plaintiffs \u201cbelieved that the iPhone XS and XS Max would not have a notch at the top of the phone\u201d because of the way it was depicted in marketing materials\u2014which, honestly, kind of makes sense.</p>",
            "<p>Lawsuits against Apple crop up <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/of-course-apple-is-getting-sued-over-the-old-iphone-thr-1821527096\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/of-course-apple-is-getting-sued-over-the-old-iphone-thr-1821527096', {metric25:1})\">semi-frequently</a>, but this one makes an interesting case for Apple\u2019s alleged shady marketing of its newer models.

            "<p>Over the past few years, Ossia has impressed us with <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/an-iphone-charging-in-midair-is-the-coolest-ces-demo-i-1751438193\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/an-iphone-charging-in-midair-is-the-coolest-ces-demo-i-1751438193', {metric25:1})\">demonstrations of its over-the-air power delivery system</a> which promises to make charging cables and pads obsolete. But it\u2019s always been just demos of prototypes, which feels like a constant tease of a future we want <em>right now</em>. For CES 2019, however, Ossia worked with accessories maker Spigen to develop the first truly wireless charging case for smartphones, and given us a more solid timeline of when the company\u2019s wireless power tech will be available to everyone.<br></p>",

            "<p>The Spigen Forever Sleeve is reminiscent of other charging cases that pack an additional battery designed to top off your smartphone without requiring you to find a power outlet. Designed for the iPhone X, with other iterations planned for additional devices later on, the Forever Sleeve also features one of Ossia\u2019a Cota chips allowing it to receive and convert wireless power signals into usable electricity.</p>",
            "<p>As long as a user is standing within 10 to 12 feet of an Ossia wireless power transmitter, their phone will be perpetually powered. But that could be dramatically improved as today Ossia also announced a new version of its wireless technology that uses a 5.8GHz signal, instead of the 2.4GHz signal it\u2019s relied on to date. The upgrade will increase both the range and power of its wireless power delivery, while reducing the size of the transmitter and receiver chips required, making it easier for OEMs to integrate the charging technology into their products.</p>",
            "<p>Ossia won\u2019t lock down an exact date for when its wireless power solution can be purchased, which is a little frustrating given it\u2019s a technology we\u2019re so excited about. But the company\u2019s optimistic that the production version of the Forever Sleeve, and a consumer-ready version of the Ossia power transmitter, will be available by 2020 at the latest. I\u2019m definitely tired of waiting but can easily stomach one more year for the chance to finally rid ourselves of cords, cables, dongles, wall warts, and all the comparatively prehistoric charging solutions we currently rely on.</p>",

        "text": [
            "<p>Remember how tech bloggers seemed so jazzed about the iPhone XR because it was like the very expensive iPhone XS but incredibly cheaper? It looks like the public is not as jazzed. Nikkei Asian Review <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Apple-cancels-production-boost-for-budget-iPhone-XR-sources\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Apple-cancels-production-boost-for-budget-iPhone-XR-sources', {metric25:1})\">reports</a> that Apple has canceled a production boost for the iPhone XR, which is apparently not selling as well as the company had originally anticipated. The iPhone 8, however, is selling better than expected. Maybe people like the Home button!</p>",
            "<p>This must be an awful surprise for Apple\u2019s accountants. Based on the company\u2019s marketing strategy, the new Face ID-enabled iPhones were destined for success. Yes, there were early murmurs about bad iPhone X sales, but Apple CEO Tim Cook <a href=\"https://www.cultofmac.com/545241/iphone-x-sales-analysts-predictions-wrong-incorrect/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.cultofmac.com/545241/iphone-x-sales-analysts-predictions-wrong-incorrect/', {metric25:1})\">later disavowed them</a>, announcing that the first iPhone without a Home button was the company\u2019s best-selling model for every week that it was available. This was also Apple\u2019s first $1,000 iPhone, leaving many to wonder if the four-figure sum might be asking too much of consumers at a time when most cheaper smartphones do all the things you\u2019d want a smartphone to do.</p>",
            "<p>Then, along came the iPhone XR. With that big, pretty screen, it looks a lot like the pricier iPhone X, and at $750, it costs a lot less. It also lacks the Home button and Touch ID security from earlier iPhone models. But why would anyone want those old things now that Apple lets you unlock your phone with your face?</p>",
            "<p>Hard to say. If Nikkei\u2019s sources are correct, there are presumably many thousands of people who would like to keep the old Home button and a slightly smaller screen. Those sources report that Foxconn is producing up to 100,000 fewer iPhone XR units per day than Apple had initially planned\u2014\u201cdown 20% to 25% from the original optimistic outlook.\u201d Meanwhile, Apple has increased orders for the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus by 5 million units. Nikkei was not shy about why this might be the case:</p>",
            "<p>So it seems like the new iPhone X series might not be as jazzy as Apple had hoped. But maybe it\u2019s not so much that the new big-screened, Face ID-enabled devices aren\u2019t exciting. Maybe people really do just love the Home button. The iPhone XR doesn\u2019t have one. The iPhone 8 does. It\u2019s got haptic feedback, too. Tap it, and you really feel like you\u2019re doing something. You definitely don\u2019t feel like Apple has built an incredibly sophisticated camera that will scan your face even at impossible angles and unlock your bank account. The Home button is more simple than that.</p>",
            "<p>Then again, maybe these numbers are completely unrelated to an iPhone\u2019s features. It\u2019s hard to say what people like or hate based solely upon sales numbers. It\u2019s equally difficult to determine whether gadgets live or die based upon slightly different features. It might just be the price. An iPhone 8 costs $600, and an iPhone 8 Plus is $700. They\u2019re both cheaper than the iPhone XR, and for those that care, they have a feature that the iPhone XR lacks: a Home button!</p>",
            "<p>This is all, inevitably, another signal that buying an iPhone <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-tricky-economics-of-the-iphone-xs-and-the-iphone-xr-1829996656\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-tricky-economics-of-the-iphone-xs-and-the-iphone-xr-1829996656', {metric25:1})\">is more complicated than ever</a>. Apple wants you to spend $1,000 on a device, but it\u2019s also giving you more options than ever before to avoid doing so. Turns out this company is really good at selling stuff and making money. So even if the iPhone XR might not be as successful as everyone thought it would be, the world will still turn. And Apple will still make billions.</p>",

            "<p>Apple\u2019s hyped up new iPhones hold a lot of allure. Clad in a silver, space gray, or a rich gold finish and featuring the new A12 Bionic chip inside, the recently debuted iPhone XS represents the best tech Apple can jam in a phone. So naturally, one of the first things people did after getting their hands on one was tear it apart and see what\u2019s inside. And would you just look at that battery?</p>",
            "<p>Rectangular or cylindrical batteries are pretty common, but the iPhone XS\u2019 one-cell L-shaped battery is something else. Last year in the <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+X+Teardown/98975\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+X+Teardown/98975', {metric25:1})\">iPhone X</a>, Apple simply connected two rectangular batteries together in order to cram its awkward shaped battery pack in the phone. But this time on the iPhone XS, according to <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+XS++and+XS+Max+Teardown/113021?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=092118_PR_iPhoneXS%20Max%20Teardown&amp;utm_content=092118_PR_iPhoneXS%20Max%20Teardown+CID_b048d718234a4cc5743eae37a84cb087&amp;utm_source=CampaignMonitor&amp;utm_term=iPhone%20XS%20and%20iPhone%20XS%20Max\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+XS++and+XS+Max+Teardown/113021?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=092118_PR_iPhoneXS%20Max%20Teardown&amp;utm_content=092118_PR_iPhoneXS%20Max%20Teardown+CID_b048d718234a4cc5743eae37a84cb087&amp;utm_source=CampaignMonitor&amp;utm_term=iPhone%20XS%20and%20iPhone%20XS%20Max', {metric25:1})\">iFixit</a>, Apple used multiple layer sizes and folded electrode sheet to create a curvy power pack that neatly bends around other important iPhone internals like the logic board, Taptic engine and memory.</p>",
            "<p>Strangely, the iPhone XS\u2019 battery capacity of 2,659 mAh is actually slightly less than the 2,716 mAh battery in the iPhone X, which sort of makes you question if all that extra effort was worth it. Meanwhile, on the larger iPhone XS Max, Apple stuck with a simpler two-cell design to deliver the largest battery in any iPhone ever, boasting a total capacity of 3,179 mAh.<br></p>",
            "<p>And while that might sound like a lot, I still can\u2019t help but to wonder how long the XS Max would last if it had a 4,000 mAh battery like you get in a Samsung Galaxy Note 9 or a <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-triple-camera-p20-pro-is-too-cool-for-america-1825647834\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-triple-camera-p20-pro-is-too-cool-for-america-1825647834', {metric25:1})\">Huawei P20 Pro</a>. </p>",
            "<p>Elsewhere, as you\u2019d expect, the XS and XS Max share a lot of engineering and design traits with the iPhone X. However, there are a couple important improvements, most notably in the antenna and camera departments. </p>",
            "<p>While the asymmetry of the speaker and mic grilles on the bottom of XS and XS Max might look a little jarring, by deleting two holes on left, Apple made room for an extra antenna band, which according to test results from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpeedSmart/status/1041737495820554241\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://twitter.com/SpeedSmart/status/1041737495820554241', {metric25:1})\">SpeedSmart</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/iphone-xs-4g-lte-speed,news-28106.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.tomsguide.com/us/iphone-xs-4g-lte-speed,news-28106.html', {metric25:1})\">Tom\u2019s Guide</a>, and others, resulted in a serious improvement in LTE data speeds. </p>",
            "<p>As for the camera, while the iPhone XS and XS Max\u2019s rear wide-angle camera has the same 12-MP resolution as before, the actual physical size of the sensor has increased by 32 percent. This means  each individual pixel on the sensor should also be larger, allowing the iPhone to gather more light and improve the quality of photos taken in poorly lit environments.</p>",

        "author": "Alex Cranz",
        "text": [
            "<p>We\u2019ve been using the iPhone XS for exactly two weeks now. <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-xs-is-forever-1829305262\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-xs-is-forever-1829305262', {metric25:1})\">It is unsurprisingly a great phone</a>\u2014the best iPhone that\u2019s ever been made, despite a <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/major-complaints-about-the-iphone-xs-are-stacking-up-1829447724\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/major-complaints-about-the-iphone-xs-are-stacking-up-1829447724', {metric25:1})\">smattering of complaints</a> and issues that have cropped up. Now, after two weeks of testing, here\u2019s a closer look at the phone\u2019s processor and battery.</p>",
            "<p>If you watched Apple\u2019s iPhone announcement last month then, like me, you had to sit through what felt like an hour of the company praising the processor in the newest batch of iPhones. Tim Cook said it was powerful, and he noted it was one of the first 7nm chips found in a product. But what the hell does any of that even mean?</p>",
            "<p>We\u2019ve been trying to get to the bottom of Apple\u2019s A12 claims (that it is much faster, better for battery life, and more equipped for machine learning) since we got our hands on the iPhone XS, and the answer to the question of \u201cis the A12 better\u201d is... complicated. iOS devices are unique in that the same company is designing the processor and the software and nearly everything that comes between them. There are few devices engineered as neatly as an iPhone. Everything is designed to be snappy, and Apple\u2019s processors only stop being fast when Apple starts producing software that\u2019s more resource intensive than the chips might be able to handle.</p>",
            "<p>So the A11 found in iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and X is, for the most part, going to <em>feel </em>as fast as the A12 found in the XS, XS Max, and the yet to be released XR. People aren\u2019t crunching a lot of numbers in iPhone apps so all your gains are tiny.</p>",
            "<p>But they do add up, and maybe those micro improvements are enough! Take Face ID for instance. Like it or not this appears to be the way we\u2019ll be opening iPhones for the foreseeable future. That means how fast these phones open matters. And the XS simply opens faster than the X. When we measured the two opening in our video review, the XS was demonstrably faster. Think about 80 milliseconds. We can\u2019t attribute this improvement entirely to the processor, but it shows how even a small change can make a big difference.</p>",
            "<p>Of course, our testing of processor intensive tasks didn\u2019t show quite so much improvement, possibly because apps haven\u2019t been written to take advantage of the new chip\u2019s firepower just yet. <em>PUBG</em> is rare mobile game where you can configure the graphics, so I set it to Ultra on both the iPhone X, iPhone XS, and Samsung Note 9, and then plugged them into Gamebench\u2014software that is available on macOS and Windows that allows you to measure the performance of a phone, including frames rendered per second and GPU load. (To be clear, the A12 has integrated graphics, in case that wasn\u2019t obvious.)</p>",
            "<p>The X ran the game at 41 frames per second, while the Note 9 ran it at 40 fps on average, and the XS ran at 39 fps\u2014all pretty much the same. The big difference was the average GPU load for the X was 52-percent and the Note 9 was 58-percent, while the average GPU load for the XS was just 21.65-percent. The iPhone XS has a lot more headroom there that could be taken advantage of if a developer optimized for the chip\u2019s power. The very best of what the device can do hasn\u2019t yet been realized. (More on that below.)</p>",
            "<p>Moving over to Geekbench, a synthetic benchmark that runs a series of tests meant to mimic a workload on a mobile chip. In Geekbench the A12 did better than not only the A11 but also Android competitors like Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 835 and 845. In Geekbench 4's multicore benchmark the XS did 11,360 while the XS Max did 11,555. The 845 in the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 did just 9012, while last year\u2019s A11 in the iPhone X did 10,362. While in the Compute test the XS and XS Max both managed over 20,000, with the X doing 16,110, and the Note 9 doing 14,419.</p>",
            "<p>The phones powered by the A12 performed better than any other phone we\u2019ve seen. But it\u2019s typical of synthetic benchmarks like Geekbench to produce great numbers to brag about. In most instances, you\u2019re probably not going to notice much of an improvement there.</p>",
            "<p>Battery life is a different story. When Apple started talking about the A12, it noted that its one of the first consumer chips to use a 7nm process. The A11 and Qualcomm\u2019s 845 both use 10nm processes\u2014same as the majority of Intel\u2019s 8th generation mobile CPUs. The smaller the process, the faster a chip can theoretically be, because there\u2019s less space that information has to travel.</p>",
            "<p>Fast is crucial to battery life in most modern mobile processors. The idea, popularized by Intel, is that the chips should always require the same amount of power, but that the faster a chip finishes processes and returns to idle the less power is consumed. This is why, theoretically, the XS can actually have a smaller battery than the X and still have better battery life. The A12 should do everything just much more efficiently than the A11\u2014and we see that in the results for <em>PUBG</em>, where the A12 was getting nearly the exact same framerate but by using a lot less of the processor.</p>",
            "<p>In our battery test, in which we set the brightness of the phone to 200 nits, turn off all additional modems and notifications, and stream a video over wifi, that theory proved pretty dang true! The iPhone X with its A11 processor and 2716 mAh battery lasted 9 hours and 56 minutes. The iPhone XS with its A12 processor and 2658 mAh battery lasted over an hour more at 11 hours and 11 minutes. And the iPhone XS Max, with its much larger 3174 mAh battery lasted 13 hours and 7 minutes.</p>",
            "<p>For reference, the Samsung Note 9, with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor and huge 4000 mAh battery, lasted 14 hours and 11 minutes.</p>",
            "<p>And in my own anecdotal experience, I had the iPhone XS go from 5 A.M. until 5 P.M. with heavier than average use. At that point, it hit 10-percent battery and I put it into Airplane mode just so I could have some juice on my walk home after dinner and drinks with a friend. The iPhone X, with its slightly larger battery, lasted around the same amount of time.</p>",

            "<p>We know for sure the A12 was the top performer in Geekbench and saw exceptional results in WebXPRT, Gamebench, and even a quick and dirty Face ID benchmark as well.

Apple claims these featured require the A12's computational power and won\u2019t ever be possible on earlier CPUs.</p>",
            "<p>Apart from saving portrait pics from being too blurry and enjoying better battery life, there\u2019s not much you can actually do right now to take advantage of the A12. So don\u2019t let the promise of a faster processor convince you to pick up a new iPhone right away. Yes, it\u2019s going to last longer than what\u2019s available, so it\u2019s a smart buy if you don\u2019t update often, but it\u2019s not worth the upgrade all by itself.</p>"

            "<p>In the midst of all those announcements, Apple quietly removed three of the most important iPhones in recent history from its online store, including the iPhone SE.</p>",
            "<p>When the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/iphone-se-review-the-phone-that-proves-apple-is-out-of-1768638745\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/iphone-se-review-the-phone-that-proves-apple-is-out-of-1768638745', {metric25:1})\">iPhone SE</a> came out in the spring of 2016, it was a big deal because, even though the phone wasn\u2019t particularly innovative, the idea of a new, purpose-built midrange device from Apple that started at just $400 was more than a welcome idea. And in today\u2019s world of $1,000 phones, the SE\u2014whose price had fallen to $350 in recent times\u2014served as the lone bright spot for people who only wanted to buy a cheap iPhone. </p>",
            "<p>Now the only way to get a less expensive iPhone is to wait for newly announced devices to get old. That\u2019s a potentially worrying trend, because it implies that if someone doesn\u2019t want to drop $750 or $1,000 on device, they don\u2019t deserve to own brand new shit. </p>",
            "<p>Yes, technically you can still buy a \u201cnew\u201d iPhone 7 from Apple, and with a new starting price of $450, it\u2019s not all that expensive. But if you think a phone that first debuted back in September 2016 is new, there\u2019s a bunch of car makers that would probably love to talk to you.</p>",
            "<p>But more than that, the iPhone SE was also a solid pick for people who just wanted a truly small device, and with a case that was based on the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/iphone-5s-review-its-an-iphone-past-present-and-fu-1405289089\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/iphone-5s-review-its-an-iphone-past-present-and-fu-1405289089', {metric25:1})\">iPhone 5s</a>, the SE was the last of Apple\u2019s handsets with a sharp-edged, less pebble-like design.</p>",
            "<p>However, in recent years, the iPhone SE, along with the Mac Mini, the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/its-time-to-give-up-on-the-ipad-mini-1828627374\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/its-time-to-give-up-on-the-ipad-mini-1828627374', {metric25:1})\">iPad Mini</a> and the MacBook Air, had become one of Apple\u2019s most neglected products, with it essentially not getting a single update or refresh since 2016. And that\u2019s really a shame, because with the addition of a Face ID up top and a slight reduction in its bezel size, Apple had the opportunity to turn the iPhone SE into the iPhone XE as a sort of one-two combo alongside the iPhone XR. </p>",
            "<p>OK, maybe that\u2019s just a bit of conjecture from someone who has long thought the iPhone SE could have been something so much better. In fact, there was never any evidence that Apple had bigger ambitions for the iPhone SE. For all we know, the SE was just a quick fix to help turn excess iPhone 5s bodies and A9 chips into extra revenue. </p>",
            "<p>But now we may never know, because the SE is dead, gone from Apple\u2019s online store, not even available as a refurbished unit. And alongside the iPhone SE, the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/iphone-6s-review-a-3d-touch-playground-but-not-much-e-1734182375\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/iphone-6s-review-a-3d-touch-playground-but-not-much-e-1734182375', {metric25:1})\">iPhone 6s</a> and the iPhone X have gotten the axe as well. As the last iPhone to sport a headphone jack, whether you like it or not, the passing of the iPhone 6s firmly cements Apple\u2019s commitment to a  wireless audio future. There\u2019s simply no way back now.</p>",
            "<p>Meanwhile, the death of the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/i-hate-how-much-i-love-the-iphone-x-1820086867\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/i-hate-how-much-i-love-the-iphone-x-1820086867', {metric25:1})\">iPhone X</a> isn\u2019t quite as big of a deal, as its legacy of Apple\u2019s first phone with FaceID, a slim bezel design, and of course, <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/after-just-6-months-the-phone-notch-is-already-deeply-1823469447\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/after-just-6-months-the-phone-notch-is-already-deeply-1823469447', {metric25:1})\">that notch</a>, clearly continues on in the iPhone XR, Xs, and Xs Max. And as the phone that was built in part to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone, I suppose it makes sense that the iPhone X\u2019s one-year run means it will be end up as the shortest-lived iPhone ever. </p>",
            "<p>So there you have it, just as three new iPhones have arrived to join Apple\u2019s lineup, three more iPhones have been rotated out. RIP to the iPhone X, the iPhone 6s, and the iPhone SE.</p>"

This year is no exception, and forums are filling up with reports of issues with the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. None of the problems are particularly catastrophic. At least not yet.</p>",
            "<p>Before we get into the details, it\u2019s worth pointing out that the iPhone XS devices are brand new. They\u2019ve been out in the wild for less than two weeks. The public release of iOS 12 is equally new, although it enjoyed many months in beta-testing. So it\u2019s not necessarily a surprise that a new iPhone with new software will suffer from a few bugs. We\u2019ve seen it happen before\u2014most notably in 2010, <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/5589336/apple-antennagate-and-why-its-time-to-move-on\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/5589336/apple-antennagate-and-why-its-time-to-move-on', {metric25:1})\">the year of Antennagate</a>\u2014and we\u2019ll see it again.</p>",

            "<p>Indeed, we\u2019ve got another -gate on our hands. While Antennagate dealt with an issue that caused the iPhone 4 to lose reception if you held it a certain way, this so-called Chargegate involves iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max devices that won\u2019t charge when plugged into a Lightning cable.

            "<p>There\u2019s some consensus that this must be a software issue. Not all devices experience the problem and not all that do experience it all the time.

Some people think it might not be linked to iOS 12 or the iPhone XS series at all, but rather to updated security settings in iOS 11.4.1. This change meant that an iPhone\u2019s Lightning port might not recognize a USB accessory, including a charging cable if the locked phone had been idle for some time.

            "<p>If this indeed what\u2019s causing the charging issue, it\u2019s unclear why people are just now complaining about the change. One possible explanation is that people who just spent over $1,000 on a new iPhone are paying extra close attention to how it works. We won\u2019t know for sure until Apple offers an explanation.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s also possible that a nasty bug is causing Chargegate, and that sucks. Sucks to get an expensive new phone, plug it in to charge before bed, and then wake up with a dead phone. It also sucks to go online and see an army of other Apple people are about to storm the castle in Cupertino over the same problem. Or maybe that\u2019s comforting, in a weird way.</p>",
            "<p>Okay, nobody is calling this Antennagate 2.0, but this series of complaints is similar to what we saw so many years ago. It seems even more confounding, though, because it doesn\u2019t involve how a person holds an iPhone.</p>",
            "<p>A number of iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max users\u2014many of them on the Verizon network\u2014say that they\u2019re getting worse reception than they used to in certain areas.

            "<p>These connectivity problems don\u2019t appear to be limited to LTE, either.

This issue, however, appears to be a bug related to how the device switches between 2.4GHz and 5GHz. It looks like these folks suffered speed issues because their phones were switching between the two networks and sometimes defaulting to the slower 2.4GHz network. This is thankfully something that Apple can probably fix in an iOS update.</p>",
            "<p>I <em>almost</em> called this one Cameragate, but that seems overly dramatic compared to the other two batches of complaints. That\u2019s because this seems like a feature, not a bug.</p>",
            "<p>Forum folks <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/09/28/iphone-xs-skin-smoothing-selfie-camera/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.macrumors.com/2018/09/28/iphone-xs-skin-smoothing-selfie-camera/', {metric25:1})\">are also talking about excessive skin-smoothing</a> in photos taken with the iPhone XS camera, especially the front-facing selfie camera. Some have even called it a beauty filter since it\u2019s especially noticeable on photos of faces. If you zoom in close enough, you\u2019ll see that the iPhone XS images have a softer quality. We noticed it in our testing, though it seemed related less to an unwanted beauty effect that Apple hasn\u2019t said anything about, and more about reducing noise in low-light images.

The smoother appearance of iPhone XS cameras is related to the new Smart HDR feature which combines multiple exposures to produce a better image with more realistic contrast. Because the iPhone software is getting rid of too-bright highlights and too-dark shadows, more textured images, including photos of skin, appear to be smoother. This noise reduction is necessary because the iPhone is taking multiple photos at once, each with a shorter shutter speed and higher ISO. The Smart HDR software combines these images and removes the noise. Zooming in to rough textures might reveal some loss of local contrast and make those textures appear smoother.</p>",
            "<p>Don\u2019t like this? Great news, evidence suggests that turning off Smart HDR in the camera settings might remove some of the smoothing. Another option? Don\u2019t zoom in super close on someone\u2019s skin.</p>",

The iPhone XS is better, and I\u2019ll bet you a buffalo head nickel it will have a longer lifespan. That\u2019s what I\u2019m most excited about.</p>",

            "<p>A few years ago, former Gizmodo editor Brian Barrett wrote <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/no-ones-buying-ipads-because-ipads-are-forever-1648615480\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/no-ones-buying-ipads-because-ipads-are-forever-1648615480', {metric25:1})\">a post about how iPads are forever</a>. Apple wasn\u2019t selling as many as it used to, because Apple had made the iPad so good that people didn\u2019t need to upgrade. And now I wonder if that\u2019s what\u2019s happening with the iPhone. The devices are more expensive, but they also seem more lasting. Is the iPhone XS the first iPhone you\u2019ll want to keep for five years? I think it is.</p>",
            "<p>Following tradition, Apple <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/apple-iphone-xs-the-complete-rundown-1828979967\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/apple-iphone-xs-the-complete-rundown-1828979967', {metric25:1})\">didn\u2019t change much</a> about the design of the iPhone XS. It looks like an iPhone X! However, there are a few seemingly minor differences that make it a better device.</p>",
            "<p>Let\u2019s start with the size. Again, the iPhone XS is just like the iPhone X. Both devices have a 5.8-inch OLED display and are 7.7mm-thick. That\u2019s slightly thicker than the iPhone 7, which is 7.1mm-thick, and the iPhone 8, which is 7.3mm-thick. Like the iPhone X, the iPhone XS footprint is slightly taller and slightly wider than an iPhone 8. </p>",
            "<p>For the iPhone XS Max, all those numbers edge up. The device itself is almost exactly the same size as an iPhone 8 Plus, but the iPhone XS Max is a full ounce heavier than the Plus at 7.34 ounces. So the Max is big, but if you\u2019ve been using a Plus, it won\u2019t feel much different in your hand or take up more room in your pocket. The 6.4-inch display will feel expansive, though. Using it feels a little different, too, because Apple simply stretched iOS out to fit the bigger canvas. In other words, you\u2019re seeing what you would normally see on a Plus screen except it\u2019s stretched out.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>",
            "<p>While you can\u2019t necessarily see it like you see a difference in size, the iPhone XS glass is new. Apple says the device has the \u201cmost durable glass ever on a smartphone.\u201d This is an interesting claim, especially since a ton of people said that the iPhone X was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cultofmac.com/512369/iphone-x-apples-fragile-handset-ever/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.cultofmac.com/512369/iphone-x-apples-fragile-handset-ever/', {metric25:1})\">Apple\u2019s most fragile handset ever</a>.\u201d We didn\u2019t do any drop or scratch tests with the new device, and the reports from those that did <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/09/24/iphone-xs-drop-tests/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://9to5mac.com/2018/09/24/iphone-xs-drop-tests/', {metric25:1})\">seem mixed, so far</a>. However, as someone who babied an iPhone X for a year but still ended up <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/iphone-x-damage-report-two-months-later-1822644663\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/iphone-x-damage-report-two-months-later-1822644663', {metric25:1})\">with a screen full of scratches</a> and a network of cracks on the back glass, any improvements to the device\u2019s durability are very welcome.</p>",
            "<p>Another difference that you can see is the addition of two new antenna lines. That\u2019s because the iPhone XS includes 4x4 MIMO technology for faster LTE transmission. (The iPhone X and iPhone 8 had 2x2 MIMO.) The iPhone XS also supports QAM and LAA radio technologies for better connectivity. What this alphabet soup of standards adds up to <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/09/17/iphone-xs-massive-lte-improvement-thanks-to-4x4-mimo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://9to5mac.com/2018/09/17/iphone-xs-massive-lte-improvement-thanks-to-4x4-mimo/', {metric25:1})\">is zippier uploads and downloads</a>. In our tests, the iPhone XS smoked the iPhone X, delivering speeds that were two- to three-times faster on the Verizon network.</p>",
            "<p>As it\u2019s an \u201cS\u201d iPhone, the iPhone XS is all about the guts. What I found particularly interesting, however, is that the improvements inside the iPhone XS aren\u2019t necessarily obvious. This is certainly true of the processor, which seems like it\u2019s designed to be extremely powerful and support apps that have not yet been built. I also think it\u2019s partially true for the camera, because you might have to learn new ways to take photos in order to appreciate some of the coolest features. But before we dive too deep into those two things\u2014which are the headline upgrades on the iPhone XS\u2014a quick note about Face ID. </p>",
            "<p>The Face ID hardware is the same, but Apple says it tweaked the algorithms to make it faster. And indeed, it is faster. This was actually the first thing I noticed when I started testing the iPhone XS. It seemed to unlock immediately, and I loved it, because it always felt like I needed to stare at the iPhone X for a couple seconds before it unlocked. In a side-by-side test, the iPhone XS unlocks a full beat faster than the iPhone X. I guess over the course of my life, those extra seconds add up.</p>",
            "<p>Faster is sort of the overarching theme of what the iPhone XS does. Apple says  the A12 Bionic\u2019s CPU is <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/iphone-xs/a12-bionic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.apple.com/iphone-xs/a12-bionic/', {metric25:1})\">up to 15 percent faster</a> than the A11 Bionic, and the GPU is up to 50 percent faster. Our synthetic benchmark tests did show a solid improvement, although our day-to-day testing suggested something even more interesting. The A12 Bionic seems like V12 engine running on six cylinders. </p>",
            "<p>Right now, you\u2019re only tapping into a fraction of the chip\u2019s power, and even that feels delightfully powerful compared to earlier iPhones. Star Walk 2 is buttery smooth on the iPhone XS, while it has a tendency to lag on the iPhone X. <em>Fortnite</em> loads about 15 seconds faster on the iPhone XS than on the iPhone X and <em>PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds</em> only utilizes half as much of the GPU on the iPhone XS than it does on the iPhone X. That means it should be prepared for a future of better graphics, perhaps one that the developers haven\u2019t even dreamed up yet.</p>",
            "<p> Apple\u2019s new A12 Bionic chip feels like more chip than I need right now, which is not a bad thing. It seems like it\u2019s designed not only to better handle the apps of right now but also encourage developers to push its limits with the apps of tomorrow. It also does all of this without sacrificing battery life. Both the iPhone XS and the iPhone XS Max performed as advertised with over 11 hours and over 13 hours of video playback, respectively. These all very good things, if you\u2019re like me and thinking about investing $1,000 in a new phone and want that phone to last you a few years. </p>",
            "<p>And then there\u2019s that camera module. It\u2019s neither inside nor outside the phone, which is still a little bit annoying if you want your phone to sit flat on a tabletop without a case. But that\u2019s not the point. The iPhone XS camera is better than the iPhone X camera. </p>",
            "<p>Central to the better camera system is a bigger sensor. Apple said the wide-angle camera comes with pixels that are 32-percent larger than those on the iPhone X. You really can see what a difference that extra sensor size makes when taking low-light photos, too. This street scene in Brooklyn looks fine in a photo taken with the iPhone X. </p>",
            "<p>The details of the road and cars show up under the street lights, but the illuminated restaurant sign behind it is blown out. When you look at the same shot taken with the iPhone XS, there\u2019s simply more there, including the letters on the sign.</p>",
            "<p>There\u2019s more to this than a bigger sensor. The A12 Bionic also plays a big role in enabling the camera to capture and process a lot of information very quickly. This is what makes the new Smart HDR feature possible, and I\u2019d argue that we can see the letters on that sign because of Smart HDR, which Apple says combines the best features of several different exposures to increase the dynamic range of photos. Several of us at Gizmodo tested the limits of Smart HDR, and we agreed that it\u2019s good at keeping image highlights from seeming quite so blown out. It won\u2019t rescue photos taken in too much darkness, but it will allow you to see more details when taking images in overly bright environments or taking images that have big blotches of brightness, like our restaurant sign above. </p>",
            "<p>The iPhone XS is also just generally better at dealing with highlights and shadows than other iPhones are, but its performance isn\u2019t flawless. This is most obvious in situations with more challenging lighting, like the backlit building with the dinosaur painting below. This is a tricky shot. The photo taken with the iPhone 8 Plus (left) basically shits the bed, blowing out the sky and failing to produce much detail of the brick building. The photo taken with the iPhone X (center) does a better job but looks washed out. The photo taken with the iPhone XS Max (right) reproduces textures on the building in a very realistic way, although it does lose some of the details in the bright clouds. It\u2019s the best photo out of the three, but it\u2019s still not perfect.</p>",
            "<p>Another tough situation that the iPhone XS handles well is very high contrast images, especially those with extreme bright spots like the reflections in the photos below. Check out this image of a shining copper still. Its textured exterior is a big part of what makes it interesting, but the photo taken with the iPhone X fails to preserve that texture. It\u2019s just blown out in certain spots.</p>",
            "<p>You might not even notice that you\u2019re losing detail until you see the exact same photo taken with the iPhone XS. Instead of the highlights getting blown out and turning into a glossy mess, this image preserves the delicate textures:</p>",
            "<p>Honestly, most of the photos I took with the iPhone XS<strong>\u00a0</strong>look good. Which is to say, the camera is definitely good enough for most people. The new Portrait Mode and its adjustable depth of field is especially great. This feature allows you to adjust the look of the bokeh in Portrait Mode shots, after they\u2019ve been captured. You can make the background behind the focal point completely crisp or you can make it super blurry using a new little slider that\u2019s labelled with <em>f</em>-stops in the Camera app\u2019s edit mode. You\u2019re not actually changing the <em>f</em>-stop, since it\u2019s a software trick. Nevertheless, it gives you some more flexibility with photo editing. The effect looks a little fake if you overdo it, in my opinion, but it\u2019s something I like about the new camera.</p>",
            "<p>Portrait Mode is better in general. In the past, I\u2019ve typically dealt with a lot of weird artifacts and glitches with Portrait Mode in the past, usually to do with some shortcoming in distinguishing the subject of the portrait from the background. It\u2019s hard to say how  better the iPhone XS at dealing with these challenges, but the fact that you can now adjust the bokeh effect is a useful tool in this respect. For example, if the edges of a subject  in a Portrait Mode photo look too blurry or even just not quite right, the magical little slider can tone down the bokeh effect and make the image look more realistic. It\u2019s also handy if you simply want some options for tweaking these kinds of photos, options that simply do not exist with other iPhones. The f<em>-</em>stop slider feature is not available when trying to edit Portrait Mode photos on older iPhone models.</p>",
            "<p>Oh, and if you\u2019re hungry for more examples of what the iPhone XS can do, here\u2019s a whole gallery of them. All of these photos are unedited except for some basic cropping.</p>",
            "<p>Let me be blunt with you. I want to buy the iPhone XS, but I\u2019m not sure that I will right now. At the very least, I\u2019m going to wait a few weeks to read more about the durability issues and to test out the iPhone XR. But it feels like I want to buy an iPhone XS and then not even think about buying an iPhone until after the 2020 presidential elections. </p>",
            "<p>That\u2019s because the promise of longevity is what make the iPhone XS feel special. There\u2019s nothing new about the design, which is fine with me because the design is terrific. Performance-wise, the iPhone XS is just marginally better than the iPhone X. It is tremendously better than the iPhone 8 or the iPhone 7, however, the iPhone XS also promises to remain excellent for several years to come. At least that\u2019s how it feels.</p>",
            "<p>A couple weeks ago, I wrote <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/this-is-the-iphone-xs-you-should-buy-1829026224\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/this-is-the-iphone-xs-you-should-buy-1829026224', {metric25:1})\">a blog</a> about which iPhone XS you should buy and recommended the 256GB iPhone XS in space grey on Verizon. My review unit was the exact same model except it came in the new gold color. I liked the gold! And I\u2019d also stand behind my original recommendation. The smaller iPhone XS with the mid-range storage is probably the best phone for most people. It\u2019s the one I\u2019ll buy, if I finally decide to buy one. And if you really want the jumbo dude, go ahead and get the iPhone XS Max. I hope you love it.</p>",
            "<p>The fact of the matter is that I want to love this new iPhone. I want to spend years of my life with this new iPhone. I want this new iPhone to last forever. Because wouldn\u2019t that be the best? You spend a grand on one phone, and you don\u2019t have to spend any more grands again. That\u2019s not going to happen any time soon, but at least, the iPhone XS feels like it will stick around.</p>"

            "<p>According to Kuo,  the XS Max is off to a better than expected start with sales three to four times higher than those of the iPhone XS, which is quite impressive since with a starting price of $1,100, the Max is also the most expensive iPhone ever. </p>",
            "<p>Kuo says across both models, 256GB is the most popular storage option, though part of that is due to the limited quantities of 512GB models, which rely solely on Samsung to produce the NAND flash needed for drives of that size. Kuo also says space gray and gold are significant more popular than the standard silver and white paint scheme, which makes sense since those are the new colors for 2018. </p>",
            "<p>Now a lot of this demand for the XS Max could be reasoned down to this being the second year of the iPhone X, with relatively minute differences between last year\u2019s model and the iPhone XS. But what\u2019s more surprising have been all the people who didn\u2019t see this coming. </p>",
            "<p>Phones have steadily been getting bigger for years\u2014ever since Samsung released to original Galaxy Note, which like the XS Max, was also called awkward and unwieldy at launch. In fact, if you look at the numbers, the iPhone XS Max is actually smaller than an iPhone 8 Plus\u2014measuring 6.2 x 3.05-inches versus 6.24 x 3.07 inches\u2014it just uses its screen real estate more effectively due to not wasting as much space on bezels.</p>",
            "<p>So while Apple didn\u2019t make it cheap, and contrary to what popular outcry might have you believe, Apple did give people what they wanted within the confines of its own walled garden: a phone with a truly big screen. And in  places where  iPhones also double as status symbols, being able to get your hands on the most expensive iPhone ever made probably didn\u2019t hurt sales either.</p>",
            "<p>On top of that, releasing the XS Max a month ahead of the iPhone XR is a pretty savvy business move, as it lets price-agnostic buyers get in on the action, while drumming up excitement for budget-conscious shoppers later in the fall. </p>",

            "<p><strong>Why iPhone Xs?</strong></p>",
            "<p>The iPhone X was already a great phone. It <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/i-hate-how-much-i-love-the-iphone-x-1820086867\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/i-hate-how-much-i-love-the-iphone-x-1820086867', {metric25:1})\">was almost confusingly good</a>, when it came out, and the thing <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/iphone-x-six-months-later-1825722111\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/iphone-x-six-months-later-1825722111', {metric25:1})\">has held up over time</a>. By any account, the iPhone Xs is better. It comes with a faster, smarter A12 Bionic processor. It comes with better sensors on its already terrific camera, not to mention a few new software tricks that make Portrait Mode even more useful. Face ID is also faster on the iPhone Xs, which is gravy because Face ID <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/face-id-is-unstoppable-1822415803\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/face-id-is-unstoppable-1822415803', {metric25:1})\">was already awesome</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Then there\u2019s the size factor. With its 5.8-inch screen, the iPhone Xs also features the most compact design out of all the new models. That makes the whole device marginally larger than an iPhone 8 with a screen that\u2019s larger than the one on the iPhone 8 Plus. Of course, the iPhone Xs Max\u2019s 6.5-inch screen and iPhone Xr\u2019s 61.-inch screens are larger, but so are the devices. Not everybody wants a big phone.</p>",
            "<p>The iPhone Xs does start at $1,000, as did the iPhone X before it. That\u2019s a lot of money to spend on a phone, but it\u2019s safe to say that this is a device that won\u2019t need replacing, especially if Apple\u2019s claims that it has the \u201cmost durable glass ever in a smartphone.\u201d You also use your phone more than your laptop, so why not spend nearly as much on it. (Tim Cook told me to say that.) (Just kidding, Tim and I no longer speak.)<br></p>",
            "<p><strong>Why 256GB?</strong></p>",
            "<p>Apple actually made this decision easier that it used to be when it got rid of the 128GB option. It\u2019s remarkably easy to fill up a 64GB device, and the next biggest option is now 256GB. As Apple has done in the past, forcing people to upgrade from a little to a lot more storage actually makes that storage cheaper. In this case you\u2019re gaining 192GB for $100 more.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s nice that Apple will now sell you a more expensive 512GB iPhone to enable your digital hoarding tendencies. By the same dollar-per-GB calculus, this might seem like a good deal, since the extra storage gets even cheaper as you buy even more. More than half a terabyte on a smartphone seems a little too extra. 256GB should be more than enough for most people.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Why Verizon?</strong></p>",
            "<p>This one has a simple answer: coverage. Verizon <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-wireless-carrier/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-wireless-carrier/', {metric25:1})\">consistently tops the rankings</a> for most best 4G and 4G LTE. It\u2019s the nation\u2019s largest carrier and keeps building more towers, so you can expect coverage to get even better. Verizon also offers an unlimited data plan <a href=\"https://www.verizonwireless.com/plans/unlimited/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.verizonwireless.com/plans/unlimited/', {metric25:1})\">for $75 a month</a> (plus taxes and fees), although <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/verizons-new-phone-plan-proves-it-has-no-idea-what-unli-1826833546\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/verizons-new-phone-plan-proves-it-has-no-idea-what-unli-1826833546', {metric25:1})\">we\u2019ve pointed out before</a> that Verizon\u2019s definition of \u201cunlimited\u201d doesn\u2019t really mean unlimited. You might get throttled if you habitually use more than 26GB of data per month. If you\u2019re not a data hog, you can get a 5GB plan for $55 a month from Verizon. You get the good coverage no matter what.</p>",
            "<p>Obviously, not everyone is the same. You\u2019re special! Here are some thoughts for those special circumstances.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Why iPhone Xs Max?</strong></p>",
            "<p>If you really like big phones, you might absolutely love the massive iPhone Xs Max. <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/iphone-xs-max-first-impressions-just-how-jumbo-is-this-1828999615?rev=1536787990041\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/iphone-xs-max-first-impressions-just-how-jumbo-is-this-1828999615?rev=1536787990041', {metric25:1})\">It\u2019s so jumbo</a>. It\u2019s 6.2-inches tall with a screen that stretches to 6.5 inches diagonally. It\u2019s bigger than a Samsung Note 9. It\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-ipad-pop-tart-size-chart-2014-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-ipad-pop-tart-size-chart-2014-9', {metric25:1})\">bigger than a Pop Tart</a>. Big big big.</p>",
            "<p>One meaningful hardware improvement you get with this big phone is a bigger battery and better battery life. Apple says the iPhone Xs battery holds a charge \u201can-hour-and-a-half longer than the iPhone X.\u201d But seriously, you should try holding one of these things before you buy it. There\u2019s a chance your fingers <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/iphone-xs-max-first-impressions-just-how-jumbo-is-this-1828999615\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/iphone-xs-max-first-impressions-just-how-jumbo-is-this-1828999615', {metric25:1})\">will be too small</a> to do basic stuff.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Why iPhone XR?</strong></p>",
            "<p>If you don\u2019t want to spend a grand on a new phone, <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/apple-iphone-xr-the-cheaper-iphone-that-might-be-a-bet-1828979211\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/apple-iphone-xr-the-cheaper-iphone-that-might-be-a-bet-1828979211', {metric25:1})\">you might like the iPhone XR</a>, which starts at $750. This is $50 cheaper than the original price of the iPhone 8, which seems like a nice gesture on Apple\u2019s part. It\u2019s still a lot of money, but it\u2019s a lot of money for what appears to be a very good phone.</p>",
            "<p>The iPhone XR comes with Face ID and an edge-to-edge display, making it look a lot like an iPhone Xs. However, there have been some cost-cutting measures in terms of materials and construction. The case is made of aluminum rather than stainless steel, and the display is LCD rather than OLED. It also has lacks a second lens on the rear camera as well as 3D Touch on the screen. Perhaps more relevant for some is the fact that the iPhone XR is medium-sized with its 6.1-inch display. The iPhone XR also comes in six colors.</p>",
            "<p>So, for $250 less, the iPhone XR gives you fewer features than the iPhone X, but you get a little more display, albeit a lower quality Liquid Retina display rather than the Super Retina display. Without testing either, it\u2019s hard to say how the iPhone XR measures up to the pricier iPhone Xs. Does the screen look all that different? Does the camera perform that much worse? Does the aluminum frame feel that much less durable? You might not care about questions like these as much as you care about price. In which case, the iPhone XR might be for you. Also, if you want a bright yellow or blue or red or coral phone, the iPhone XR might be for you.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Why a silver or gold iPhone Xs?</strong></p>",
            "<p>By all means get the silver or gold iPhone Xs if that\u2019s your thing. The bezel on all three devices is black now. If you use a case, however, most people will never know what color your phone is.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Why iPhone 8 or iPhone 7?</strong></p>",
            "<p>If everything above sounds way too expensive, and you really want a brand new iPhone, consider both of these. Here\u2019s <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/one-week-with-the-iphone-8-1818736319\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/one-week-with-the-iphone-8-1818736319', {metric25:1})\">our review of the iPhone 8</a>, which is a perfectly good, year-old iPhone.

            "<p><strong>Why the Apple Upgrade Plan?</strong></p>",
            "<p>Apple really wants you to buy a new iPhone and then it wants you to buy another new one in a year. That\u2019s why it offers the Apple Upgrade Plan, which is really just an interest-free, 24-month loan with the price of AppleCare+ included. Carriers also offer similar loan programs, although those don\u2019t come with AppleCare+ tacked on. The 256GB iPhone Xs we recommend above <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-xs#00,13,31\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-xs#00,13,31', {metric25:1})\">will cost</a> $56.16 a month with the Apple Upgrade Plan. By comparison, you\u2019ll pay $47.87 a month through the Verizon Device Payment Plan, and you will not get AppleCare+.</p>",
            "<p>Speaking from experience, the Apple Upgrade Plan is very easy, likely because of that whole Apple-wants-you-to-buy-a-new-iPhone thing. If you want to upgrade after a year, you just order a new iPhone online. Then, you either take your old one into a store and pick up a new one, or you get the new phone delivered to your house and mail back the old one. If you don\u2019t want to upgrade, you\u2019ll own the iPhone free and clear, after you make all your loan payments.</p>",
            "<p>In other words, you should go with the Apple Upgrade if you like convenience and agree that AppleCare+ is worth paying for.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Why AppleCare+?</strong></p>",
            "<p>AppleCare+ pays for itself, if anything ever happens to your phone. If you break your iPhone Xs screen, Apple will replace it for $30, if you have AppleCare+. An iPhone Xs screen replacement will cost you $280. AppleCare+ costs $200. Let\u2019s look at the math. If you pay that $200 upfront and $30 for a broken screen, you\u2019re out $230. Otherwise, it\u2019s $280. Apple also covers two accidental damage incidents, so the saving will just keep adding up for clumsy people.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Why T-Mobile?</strong></p>",
            "<p>There are a lot of reasons to pick T-Mobile over Verizon, but the main one is value. For $70 a month (with no taxes or fees), you can get <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans', {metric25:1})\">the T-Mobile One plan</a>. That\u2019s just a few bucks cheaper than the Verizon plan, but you get perks like Netflix, Go-go in-flight wifi, unlimited service in Mexico and Canada, as well as free texting and data abroad. You also won\u2019t get throttled unless you use 50GB of data or more. T-Mobile might not make sense if you live in a more rural area, as its network isn\u2019t as big as Verizon\u2019s, though.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Why iPhone?</strong></p>",
            "<p>Good question. <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/iphone-x-alternatives-great-phones-for-people-who-dont-1806246293\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/iphone-x-alternatives-great-phones-for-people-who-dont-1806246293', {metric25:1})\">Here are some alternatives</a>.</p>"

        "author": "Sam Rutherford",
        "text": [
            "<p>One year after the release of the iPhone X, Apple has returned in 2018 to completely revamp its entire phone lineup with multiple new handsets based on last year\u2019s $1,000 flagship: So say hello to the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/iphone-xs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.apple.com/iphone-xs/', {metric25:1})\">iPhone Xs</a>. But that\u2019s not all, because this year, Apple\u2019s flagship has a super-sized sibling in the new iPhone Xs Max.<br></p>",
            "<p>As before, the smaller iPhone Xs features a 5.8-inch screen, while the new Xs Max gets a monstrous 6.5-inch screen that\u2019s even bigger than what you get on a <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-note-9-is-the-best-big-phone-1828348138\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-note-9-is-the-best-big-phone-1828348138', {metric25:1})\">Samsung Galaxy Note 9</a>, with both sporting OLED display tech for extra rich colors in pictures and videos. But for those afraid of what sounds like a monstrous device, fear not, because thanks to much slimmer bezels, the iPhone Xs Max is actually about the same size as last year\u2019s iPhone 8 Plus. </p>",
            "<p>Additionally, Apple says its OLED screens are now even brighter and sport 120Hz touch-sensitivity\u00a0and HDR support for enhanced viewing and smoothness, and for all you 3D Touch fans out there, both the Xs and Xs Max have that too. But a good viewing experience isn\u2019t all about the screen\u2014sound matters too. So Apple has given both phones new speakers with what Apple is calling wide stereo sound as well.</p>",
            "<p>Of course, one of the iPhone X\u2019s most loved and hated features has returned as well, with both the Xs and Xs Max getting Face ID notches up top. Powered by Apple\u2019s TrueDepth camera system, crammed inside that little notch is an ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, flood illuminator, infrared camera, and a 3D dot projector that can scan your face to make sure that you\u2014and hopefully only you\u2014can unlock your device. Apple says it has even upgraded the iPhone\u2019s algorithms and secure enclave so that Face ID recognizes you faster.<br></p>",
            "<p>Like clockwork, inside both the Xs and Xs Max, Apple has once again made a new chip called the A12 Bionic to help boost general performance and AI-related processing. Apple claims the A12 Bionic is the industry\u2019s first 7 nanometer chip, though <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/31/huawei-kirin-980-7-nanometer-ai-chip-for-the-mate-20.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/31/huawei-kirin-980-7-nanometer-ai-chip-for-the-mate-20.html', {metric25:1})\">Huawei would almost certainly disagree</a>. It\u2019s got a 4-core CPU and a 6-core GPU totaling 6.9 billion transistors, with a mixture of high and low-performance cores in order to more efficiently handle various workloads with energy efficiency gains of up to 40 or 50 percent. <br></p>",
            "<p>And when it comes to the \u201cBionic\u201d part of the A12, Apple says the real star of the chip should be its neural engine which is comprised of eight cores dedicated to AI and machine learning duties. Elsewhere, other parts of Apple\u2019s SoC boast improved ISPs, video processing, memory controllers and more, which should result in more fluid operation, something that has been one of the iPhone\u2019s biggest selling points over the years. </p>",
            "<p>And for those who need a ton of room to store photos, videos, apps and anything else, max storage on the iPhone has doubled from 256GB to 512GB. Apple is even saying that with the new A12 Bionic and some of the performance upgrades in iOS 12, launching apps on a new iPhone Xs or Xs max should happen 30 percent faster. </p>",
            "<p>For all your picture taking needs, Apple has redesigned the iPhone Xs\u2019 camera with new dual 12-MP sensors: one for wide-angle shots, and one for telephoto. Inside, the sensor itself sports larger 1.4 micron pixels, with the wide angle lens getting an aperture of f/1.8. Unfortunately, the zoom on the telephoto lens has remained pat at 2X, though at least both cameras will come with optical image stabilization. </p>",
            "<p>And when you want to shoot things with portrait mode or special depth effects, both cameras can work together to add extra dimension to your shots. </p>",
            "<p>Behind the scenes, the Apple\u2019s image signal processor is also working harder to improve your pics by more accurately setting white balance, focus, reducing noise, preserving highlights and more, then combining all those adjustments into a single high-quality composite. </p>",
            "<p>And for 2018, Apple\u2019s new Smart HDR feature will now shoot a four-shot burst to make sure you don\u2019t miss a moment, while additional interframes and long-exposures are snapped to help capture as much detail as possible. Even the iPhone Xs\u2019 bokeh (the blurry out of focus part of a photo) has been improved to better mimic a big DSLR or mirrorless camera, and if you\u2019re still not satisfied with that, you will even be able to adjust a picture\u2019s depth of field after the shot has been taken.<br></p>",
            "<p>So how \u2018bout that battery life? For the iPhone Xs, Apple says it will last just 30 minutes longer than last year\u2019s iPhone X. That\u2019s not exactly a huge increase, which is preciesly where the iPhone Xs Max comes in. Featuring the biggest battery Apple has ever put in an iPhone, the iPhone Xs Max should result in an extra hour and 30 minutes of runtime over an iPhone X.<br></p>",
            "<p>And as a bonus for frequent travelers, both the iPhone Xs and Xs Max will come with space for dual SIMs, so you can switch off between multiple phone numbers and data plans on the fly. Though depending on where you buy your phone, you\u2019ll either have the choice of one SIM card plus an eSIM, or two physical SIM cards for phones sold in China and elsewhere. </p>",
            "<p>Both the iPhone Xs and Xs Max will be available in 64GB, 256GB and 512GB storage sizes, with the smaller Xs starting at $1,000, and the larger Xs Max starting at $1,100. They will be available for pre-order on Friday, September 14, with shipments going out a week later on September 21st. </p>"

        "author": "Alex Cranz",
        "text": [
            "<p>Apple does not typically do budget devices, but as they go, the iPhone XR comes pretty close. While hardly cheap (a budget phone should be under $400, not $750!), it represents a calculated attempt at creating a more affordable device that isn\u2019t a tremendous compromise. Something powerful enough that you can enjoy the perks of having the latest tech, without having to spend top dollar. And that\u2019s an extremely big deal, especially if spending $1000 on a phone feels like too much for you.</p>",
            "<p>If you\u2019re trying to choose between the $750 XR and the<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-xs-is-forever-1829305262\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-xs-is-forever-1829305262', {metric25:1})\"> XS and XS Max</a>, which start at $1,000 and $1,100 respectively, you\u2019ll find that there aren\u2019t too many differences on paper. They all use the same Face ID that we <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/face-id-is-unstoppable-1822415803\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/face-id-is-unstoppable-1822415803', {metric25:1})\">loved from last year\u2019s X.</a> They all have a big notch and edge-to-edge displays. They\u2019re running on the same A12 processor (<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/iphone-xs-guts-report-how-fast-is-the-a12-processor-a-1829388773#_ga=2.103138816.166644498.1540158828-1595880060.1539636540\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/iphone-xs-guts-report-how-fast-is-the-a12-processor-a-1829388773#_ga=2.103138816.166644498.1540158828-1595880060.1539636540', {metric25:1})\">you can read our take on that here</a>). But the XR is much cheaper than the XS, and cutting the cost required quite a few compromises. The sides are aluminum instead of steel and it\u2019s rated to IP67 instead of IP68\u2014which means it\u2019s good for up to 30 minutes of immersion in 1 meter of water instead of 2 meters. It\u2019s also sized oddly, finding itself smack in middle between the XS and XS Max instead of being larger or smaller than both. Yet the biggest two differences are the display and the cameras. The XR uses a cheaper LCD display instead of the vibrant OLED found in the XS, and it has only one camera on the back instead of two.</p>",
            "<p>Those are some notably major cost-cutting measures for a $750 phone. Consider that if you\u2019re willing to ditch Apple, there are some loaded phones for a lot less: OnePlus makes a<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/oneplus-6-review-the-best-android-phone-that-wont-dest-1826158898#_ga=2.99395102.166644498.1540158828-1595880060.1539636540\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/oneplus-6-review-the-best-android-phone-that-wont-dest-1826158898#_ga=2.99395102.166644498.1540158828-1595880060.1539636540', {metric25:1})\"> great $550 phone</a> that includes dual rear cameras, an OLED display, and a current generation chipset!<strong> </strong>But Apple has always done \u201cinexpensive\u201d devices differently than the rest. In some cases, cheaper devices mean older models, like the iPhone 7 or the MacBook Air, that just stay in circulation way past their prime. In others, they are new underpowered devices, like the iPhone SE or 5c, featuring appallingly outmoded hardware. In both cases, the compromises have been painful enough to make the devices at least somewhat unappealing. With the iPhone XR, Apple has gotten its take on an affordable device right.</p>",

The XR is the first phone Apple\u2019s produced in a playful color palate in a while. Besides the traditional white and black, there\u2019s also a lovely red, coral, yellow, and blue. The colors are eye-catching, though the aluminum sides don\u2019t match the vibrant glass backs. Consequently, the phone can look a little cheap, especially next to the stainless steel sides on the XS. But if you\u2019re like me you\u2019ll find yourself shoving it into a case at the earliest opportunity to protect all that glass and easily scratchable aluminum. And that means your eyes will be immediately drawn to the display.</p>",
            "<p>Just like the XS and Max, the XR has a notch, and as with those phones, it gives it a sense of ostentatious luxury. At a glance, this phone looks expensive. The True Depth camera embedded in the notch gives the phone the ability to use Face ID which is just a hair faster than the Face ID introduced in last year\u2019s iPhone X. If you\u2019ve been reluctant to upgrade because you prefer Touch ID, you\u2019ll need to come to terms with that on your own. Touch ID is gone. This phone, and likely all iPhones going forward, will rely on your face to unlock, and I for one am entirely okay with that. (You can use an old-fashioned passcode if you don\u2019t like your phone looking at you.)</p>",
            "<p>I\u2019ve been using a 5.8-inch iPhone X for the last year and have never thought that display to be too small, but next to the XR it feels minuscule. The 6.1-inch display packed into the XR chassis splits the difference between the enormous 6.5-inch display in the Max and the 5.8-inch display in the XS and X. The 8 Plus\u2019s 5.5-inch display is also dwarfed by the XR\u2019s despite having a larger body overall. However you might feel about the notch, you\u2019ll find it difficult to look at an 8 Plus or older iPhone and not think they look positively lame next to the expansive display on the XR.<br></p>",
            "<p>Now about that compromise. The XR display is not nearly as good as the display found in the XS or Max. Those devices use an OLED display with rich blacks and enviable contrast. The XR uses an LCD display, which can\u2019t get nearly as black\u2014so images look a little washed out in comparison and when watching content with black bars on the side, the notch sticks out<strong>\u00a0</strong>in a way it doesn\u2019t on iPhones with an OLED display.</p>",
            "<p>Its 1792 x 828 resolution is much lower resolution than both the XS and last year\u2019s 8 Plus, but you probably won\u2019t notice that. What you will notice is the pixel density. The iPhone XR stoops to 326 ppi\u2014the same as the iPhone 8. The XS, by comparison, has a pixel density of 458ppi, while the iPhone 8 Plus has a density of 401ppi. What this means is that you can see the pixels of the<strong>\u00a0</strong>XR\u2019s LCD more easily than you might other phones. The pixels are evident if you\u2019re looking for them\u2014 you\u2019ll need a macro lens, magnifying glass or excellent close-range visual acuity, but they\u2019re there!<br></p>",
            "<p>Surprisingly less obvious is the size of the damn thing. At 5.94 inches by 2.98 inches by .33 inches, the XR rests squarely between the XS (5.64 inches by 2.79 inches by 0.30 inches) and the XS Max (6.24 inches by 3.07 inches by 0.30 inches). It\u2019s smaller than the Max, as well as the identically-sized iPhone 8 Plus. Meanwhile, it\u2019s a little larger than the XS.</p>",
            "<p>To get more specific, it\u2019s about a third of an inch taller than the XS, and a third of an inch shorter than the XS Max. It\u2019s also .19 inches wider than the XS, and 0.07 inches narrower than the Max. Those differences feel small, but they\u2019re surprisingly crucial for a lot of potential buyers. You\u2019ll absolutely notice the size if you\u2019re used to smaller phones like the XS, SE, or even the standard 8.</p>",
            "<p>Personally, I was put off by the size of the XR immediately, but after a long weekend with the device, I\u2019ve found myself much less annoyed. Would I like a smaller budget phone that doesn\u2019t compromise speed or display quality? Absolutely! Do I find the XR unusable in my teeny tiny hands? Nope! As with the Max, Apple has included a feature, deep in the Accessibility settings, that lets you drag the top of the phone down towards the middle of the display so you can access the absolutely vital systems drop down. It takes a little getting used to, and you\u2019ll screw up activating it the first few times, but by the end of the weekend, I found myself to be something of a pro with the feature.<br></p>",
            "<p>If size is a major consideration for you, I\u2019d encourage you to go into a store and hold the XR in your hand\u2014it\u2019s the only real way to know if it\u2019s too big for you and your back pocket.</p>",
            "<p>The last time Apple made a serious attempt at a budget phone it was the iPhone SE\u2014a device with great hardware design but a processor at least a year older than the other phones made by Apple. This time around, Apple is not asking users to compromise speed for price, and the XR has the same zippy A12 processor as the XS and XS Max.</p>",
            "<p>In day-to-day use app use, like web browsing and checking your email, you won\u2019t notice a difference between what it can do compared to the pricier phones or versus the A11 in last year\u2019s iPhones. One exception is battery life. The A12 has worked wonders on the battery life of the phones that contain it. We saw this with the XS, which lasted about an hour and ten minutes longer than the X in our tests, and we see it again with the XR which lasted quite a bit longer than the 8 Plus, despite the 8 Plus having a larger battery.</p>",
            "<p>In our test, in which we set the brightness to 200 nits, turn off all radios except the wifi, and stream a video on YouTube until the phone powers down, the iPhone 8 Plus lasted a measly 9 hours and 10 minutes and the iPhone XR lasted an impressive 11 hours and 59 minutes. For comparison, the iPhone XS Max (3174 mAh) lasted 13 hours and 7 minutes, and the XS (2658 mAh) lasted 11 hours and 11 minutes.<br></p>",
            "<p>The other noticeable change the A12 delivers is in camera performance. It lets the XR pull off tricks with a single lens that last year\u2019s iPhone 8 (the only single lens phone from Apple in 2017) could not. This processor actually lets the XR properly compete with the 8 Plus, a phone with twice the number of cameras on the back.</p>",
            "<p>And yes, one of the most important things about phones these days is the camera. From messaging to social media, it\u2019s just so central to much of what we do with our phones.<strong> </strong>The XR uses software and the A12 processor to, for the most part, deliver photo performance comparable to the 8 Plus. It has a wider lens (26mm versus 28mm) so it captures more of the world in a snap, but the images are sharp and vibrant (though, as with the XS, the Smart HDR feature can sometimes be too aggressive and result in smoothing effects <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/major-complaints-about-the-iphone-xs-are-stacking-up-1829447724#_ga=2.37129888.166644498.1540158828-1595880060.1539636540\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/major-complaints-about-the-iphone-xs-are-stacking-up-1829447724#_ga=2.37129888.166644498.1540158828-1595880060.1539636540', {metric25:1})\">critics have derided as unnatural beautification</a>).</p>",
            "<p>If you notice I keep comparing the XR to the 8 Plus and not the XS or XS Max\u2014that\u2019s because there\u2019s just a $50 price difference between the $700 8 Plus and the $750 XR. It feels like the more apt phone to draw comparisons to\u2014especially when we talk cameras. Because the XR actually uses the exact same wide-angle lens and sensor as the XS and XS Max. The only difference, camera-wise, between the XR and Apple\u2019s flagship phones is it lacks a telephoto lens.<br></p>",
            "<p>So when I went on a long walk through Red Hook over the weekend, I left the XS and Max at home and carried just the XR and 8 Plus. I found myself not actually missing the telephoto lens (a 56mm equivalent) I from the XS. Sure it would have been more handy for snapping a shot of a sign well out of reach, but when taking pictures of a flower, my attempts at a macro shot with the XR were sharper and clearer than the 8 Plus despite the 40 miles-per-hour wind whipping my hand and the flowers all around.</p>",
            "<p>The XR also caught more details of the waves in this shot of the Upper Bay. And note the clouds\u2014where you can again see more details thanks to the superior dynamic range of the XR. It simply caught more of the real world in a photo and translated it to the display.<br></p>",
            "<p>The improved dynamic range helped in this photo of a street sign at night too. The red hand in the photo below is just a big orange blob when shot with the 8 Plus, but you can see each individual bulb with the XR.<br></p>",
            "<p>But while the camera quality is impressive, there is one major shortcoming\u2014the XR has the full Portrait Mode on the front cameras, but not on the back. Portrait Mode allows the phone\u2019s cameras to mimic the creamy bokeh found in larger standalone cameras giving you a nice blurry background that better highlights your subject. On smartphones, this typically requires two cameras placed by one another. Any iPhone with Face ID can do it on the front\u2014making for attractive selfies. As two cameras are required phones like the 7 and 8 have been unable to do it. Only the 7 Plus, 8 Plus, X, XS, and XS Max could accomplish portrait photos with their dual rear cameras.<br></p>",
            "<p>But despite having a single rear camera the XR uses software and the sheer number-crunching power of the A12 processor to accomplish a similar effect, with two big caveats. One is that it will only do three of the portrait lighting modes: Natural, Studio, and Contour. The Stage Light and Stage Light Mono modes won\u2019t work\u2014which means no all black background for portraits shot with the rear camera. But the second caveat has the potential to be the bigger one\u2014the rear Portrait Mode only works with human faces. Teddy Ruxpin, Funko dolls, and my roommate\u2019s cat do not count. A pop up will appear noting a human face needs to be in the frame for Portrait Mode to work.</p>",
            "<p>At first, this felt like it could be a deal breaker, but I\u2019ve always found using Portrait Mode with the rear camera to be a challenge. You have to have just the right amount of light and distance so snapping a quick pic of your cat is usually out of the question. Not having the pressure of pulling off a clutch portrait snap is kind of nice\u2014even if I miss the flexibility it allows.<br></p>",
            "<p>As we\u2019ve said numerous times in this review, compared to the iPhone XS, the iPhone XR is full of compromises. If you want a brand new cutting-edge iPhone for under $1,000 you\u2019ll have to sacrifice some of your rear portrait shots. And you\u2019ll have to sacrifice the prettier display. Yet at this point, for most people, I think the sacrifices are acceptable. If you are a nerdy gadget lover, these are limitations that will seem disappointing. I assure you that in practice they are not.</p>",
            "<p>The iPhone XR is really good, just as the XS, XS Max, X, 8, 8 Plus, and even the 7 and 7 Plus are. The improvements we\u2019re seeing year to year are nice, but they\u2019re rarely the kind of improvements that would motivate a person to go drop $750 or more on a phone.</p>",
            "<p>In that respect, the iPhone XR isn\u2019t a required upgrade to people owning the 8 or 8 Plus. It isn\u2019t even required if you own the 7 or 7 Plus. But the upgrades are very, very good, and you\u2019ll find yourself smiling as you appreciate the photos it takes, or as you relish the fact your phone can last through not just a cross-country flight, but the awful delays on both ends of the flight too.</p>",
            "<p>The XR is good enough that I don\u2019t miss the XS. Apple undercut itself, and we\u2019re all better off for it.</p>"
