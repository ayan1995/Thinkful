{"review": ["<p>Face ID \u2013 Apple\u2019s facial recognition system that replaces the fingerprint-scanning Touch ID \u2013 is simple to set up, with the iPhone X encouraging you to put your face into view at the start; spin your head around a couple of times and you're ready to go.</p>", "<p>That's all you need to do in order to be able to unlock your phone with your face, and as long as the iPhone X can see your eyes, nose and mouth you'll be able to get into your handset easily.</p>", "<p><a class=\"fwd-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-final-cut-pro-x\">Read more: Apple Final Cut Pro X</a></p>", "<p>And we really do mean easily \u2013 Face ID has far, far exceeded our expectations for the new biometric technology. We've used facial recognition on other phones many times, and it's been erratic and, well, terrible.</p>", "<p><em>Watch our review of FaceID below.</em></p>", "<p>Apple's facial recognition tech is leagues ahead of anything else on the market right now \u2013 it's proved almost flawless in our testing.</p>", "<p>Whether you\u2019re in a pitch-black room, in low light or on the move, you simply raise the iPhone X up, look at the screen and you're unlocked, and it\u2019s the same for both unlocking the phone and using apps. As mentioned, we were worried this might be a sticking point for the iPhone, but Apple has nailed it.</p>", "<p>That said, some people are finding a few issues with the service \u2013 our US mobiles editor Matt Swider has noted that it doesn't catch his face every time, for instance. While we said it works on the move if you raise your iPhone to your face, if it catches <em>part</em> of your face, it'll fail and eventually lock you out of your phone and require a passcode. Some people will yearn for the days of the Touch ID fingerprint sensor.</p>", "<p>So that's not to say there won't be some transition required for existing iPhone users. There's a slight, slight delay to unlocking at times (although it doesn't get in the way), and you need to be looking at the handset to make it work \u2013 although we did manage to unlock ours while looking elsewhere at times.</p>", "<p>It can even work if you\u2019re wearing sunglasses, as long as the infrared scanner that's actually checking out your face can penetrate the lenses. It won\u2019t work in all cases \u2013 it depends if your shades are able to let the infrared beam pass through.</p>", "<p>However, we\u2019d guess that in such instances you\u2019ll need to hold the phone a little closer, or use your passcode \u2013 much like when you can\u2019t open an older iPhone using Touch ID because you\u2019ve got a wet thumb.</p>", "<p class=\"bordeaux-image-check\"><img src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\" lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image\" onerror=\"this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" sizes=\"auto\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7jczCojTHkYxbUSEL6YsP-320-80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7jczCojTHkYxbUSEL6YsP-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7jczCojTHkYxbUSEL6YsP-650-80.jpg 650w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7jczCojTHkYxbUSEL6YsP.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7jczCojTHkYxbUSEL6YsP.jpg\"></p>", "<p class=\"mid__article\"></p>", "<p>A bigger issue will be if you're someone who leaves their iPhone flat on the desk, and uses their thumb to check out notifications \u2013 you'll now have to pick the phone up and look into the screen to see your updates.\u00a0</p>", "<p>We compared the two unlock methods side by side, and it was at that point that we realized Touch ID is a little faster than Face ID \u2013 which makes us start to wonder why Apple changed things at all.</p>", "<p>While Face ID is a brilliant implementation of facial recognition, and is more secure, it's still not as predictable as your finger finding the same spot time and time again to unlock your device.\u00a0</p>", "<p>We get that there's no space for the home button any more, but there's no reason why Apple couldn't have shoved the fingerprint scanner onto the side of the phone, in the same way as on Sony handsets.\u00a0</p>", "<p>We suspected that Apple might have been experimenting with this option, given that the side button is now larger than before, but <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2017/10/31/how-apple-built-the-iphone-x/#w6TVIovFtSqR\"><u>Apple\u2019s designers are claiming such a thing was never a consideration</u></a>.</p>", "<p>Another issue with Face ID as against Touch ID is when using Apple Pay. Where previously you'd approach the reader with your thumb over the home button and it would instantly verify the payment, with the iPhone X you'll need to double-tap the side button to activate Face ID, have it register your face, and then it'll be ready to pay.\u00a0</p>", "<p>It's not a tough system to master \u2013 after a single attempt we were able to replicate it time and again \u2013 but it's not as easy as before, which is irritating.\u00a0You'll sometimes believe you double-tapped the side button, <em>think</em> you didn't actually double tap it, tap it one more time to be sure, and realize you did double tap initially and triple tapped. This turns off the phone right as Apple Pay pops up, making your quick payment slower than paying with cash. Sometimes the Apple Pay menu is too slow.</p>", "<p>Face ID is enabled by the TrueDepth camera, which is housed in the notch at the top of the phone, and one has to wonder whether Apple has shifted to the facial recognition technology to simply have something new and exciting to help sell the new iPhone.</p>", "<p>There's no doubting that the facial mapping camera is powerful \u2013 it's incredibly accurate \u2013 but there's not much you can do with it right now, as few apps have taken advantage of the feature. Given the TrueDepth camera is probably adding a fair bit to the cost, perhaps that's part of the reason to push Face ID.</p>", "<p>Another thing the TrueDepth camera facilitates is Portrait mode, where the background is blurred in your selfies, and it's excellent.\u00a0</p>", "<p>We'll speak more about that in the camera section, but the new technology has allowed Apple to create one of the best front-facing cameras on the market.</p>", "<p>You've probably heard a fair bit about Animoji already, the feature that enables you to create talking emoji using the TrueDepth camera and your own face.</p>", "<p>It's a really fun system \u2013 you can be a talking robot, cat, dog, unicorn or piece of poo, among other avatars. The impressive thing, though, isn't that you can send an animated emoji to your friends, but the sheer accuracy of the facial mapping.</p>", "<p>Whether that's a flicker of the eyebrows making a unicorn's ears flap, or raised eyebrows pushing an alien's brow upwards... it's something you won't have seen elsewhere to this level of quality.</p>", "<p>But it's a massive novelty. It's not something you're going to buy this phone for, and after a few days you'll forget it's there. This is very much something Apple does \u2013 adding in a feature that's not a deal-breaker, but which could be useful in the future.</p>", "<p>And while you can share the videos with friends in apps other than iMessage, it's not easy to do. And if your friends don't have an iPhone X, you can still send them Animoji, but they'll want to reciprocate and won\u2019t be able to. This feature really needs to roll out to other apps - or at least those developers need to code in a similar option. Apple hasn't done that yet, though it has added four new Animoji masks with the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ios-11-release-date-news-and-features\">iOS 11.3 update</a>.</p>", "<p>This is a feature that will delight children, and we can see how developers could create some really cool apps for kids using the front-facing camera on the iPhone X; but we're still in the 'wait and see' phase as to whether the TrueDepth camera is going to be a gamechanger or just a nice piece of expensive hardware.</p>"]},
{"review": ["<p><em>Watch our review of the UI and performance of the iPhone X below.</em></p>", "<p>If you\u2019re running a recent iPhone, perhaps something from the iPhone 6 and above, then you\u2019ve probably already tried out <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ios-11-release-date-news-and-features\">iOS 11</a>\u2026 but it\u2019s rather different on the iPhone X.</p>", "<p>The main difference is the home button \u2013 or lack thereof, as you\u2019ve probably already noticed. This has been replaced by gestures, and suddenly Apple\u2019s desire to get all swipey in previous iterations of iOS makes sense today.</p>", "<p><a class=\"fwd-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-final-cut-pro-x\">Read more: Apple Final Cut Pro X</a></p>", "<p>Swiping up from the bottom of the screen no longer launches the Control Center, but rather serves as a return to home button. This takes a lot of getting used to, but it quickly becomes embedded in the muscle memory.</p>", "<p>Within a few days we were trying the same action on other phones out of habit, and it\u2019s reminiscent of the way you\u2019ll open up the menu on a Samsung phone \u2013 it just feels like it\u2019s in the right place.</p>", "<p>However, beyond that Apple has made things a little too convoluted. To open the deck of running apps, for example, you need a \u2018demi-swipe\u2019 upwards\u2026 go too far and you\u2019ll just access the home screen.</p>", "<p>To shut down said apps, it\u2019s no longer a swipe but a press <em>then</em> a swipe. This doesn\u2019t feel intuitive at all, and shows Apple had to reach a little too far to integrate all the functionality into gestures.</p>", "<p>We must say that although we didn't like the gesture where you swipe right on the bottom of the screen to move between recently-used apps at launch, it's grown on us and suddenly makes more sense to use. Apparently it makes sense to Google too, as the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/android-p-what-we-want-to-see-from-android-9\">Android P</a> uses this functionality, too.</p>", "<p>The Control Center now lives to the right of the notch at the top of the phone, with the notifications panel on the left. This <em>does </em>make sense, and we actually prefer the placement of these two \u2013 having the Control Center at the bottom got in the way of too many apps in the past.</p>", "<p class=\"mid__article\"></p>", "<p>If you\u2019re using the iPhone X in landscape mode though, you\u2019re going to run into trouble. It appears that without the notch there to separate them, the notifications panel takes up the bulk of the space at the expense of the more-useful Control Center, and you\u2019ll need to swipe from <em>exactly </em>in the top right-hand corner to get access to the latter.</p>", "<p>On to day-to-day use of the iPhone X, though, this thing is buttery smooth, with nary a glitch in sight (apart from Animoji, which kept freezing on us). That\u2019s the benefit of bringing out a phone with the new version of iOS out on the market \u2013 a lot of the kinks have been ironed out.</p>", "<p>There\u2019s a powerful engine at the heart of this iPhone, with the A11 Bionic chip running in tandem with 3GB of RAM (<a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-x-battery-size-and-ram-seemingly-revealed\"><u>according to Chinese filings</u></a>). That doesn\u2019t sound like much RAM, but it\u2019s the most Apple has ever chucked into a phone, and it shows in the speed of use.</p>", "<p>If you look at the Geekbench scores, which assess the raw power of the processor, the iPhone X is one of the most powerful phones on the market, only rivaled by the iPhone 8 Plus.\u00a0</p>", "<p class=\"bordeaux-image-check\"><img src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\" lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image\" onerror=\"this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" sizes=\"auto\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AySxE9CqeYLiMzYD6qPTUf-320-80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AySxE9CqeYLiMzYD6qPTUf-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AySxE9CqeYLiMzYD6qPTUf-650-80.jpg 650w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AySxE9CqeYLiMzYD6qPTUf.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AySxE9CqeYLiMzYD6qPTUf.jpg\"></p>", "<p>And while you can\u2019t say how good a smartphone is based on its scores, we\u2019ve seen nothing during our tests to suggest this is anything other than an incredibly powerful phone.</p>", "<p>There\u2019s very little judder anywhere (although in low-power mode everything does slow down a lot \u2013 far too much for a simple power saving when there\u2019s this much power coursing through the iPhone X), and that\u2019s a sign of a well-optimized handset.</p>", "<p>Gaming on the iPhone X is predictably strong too \u2013 we\u2019re at the point now where there are barely any titles that don\u2019t play well on flagship devices, given the amount of power under the hood.</p>", "<p>The new penchant for AR gaming, where games are played within a within a plane overlaid on your real-world surroundings, is a key part of Apple\u2019s new strategy and we managed a game of The Machines with aplomb (and that title has already been optimized for the iPhone X\u2019s screen, pleasingly).</p>", "<p>The other thing is that top gaming titles look bright and colorful on the OLED display, so all in all the iPhone X is a top choice for gaming. The only downside is that gaming seems to deplete the battery rather quickly, but that\u2019s nothing new from Apple.</p>", "<p>And don\u2019t forget about the excellent Taptic Engine (the vibrating motor) inside \u2013 this might have appeared in previous iPhones, but it really enhances gaming.\u00a0</p>", "<p>You\u2019ll get a real sense of a machine-gun firing, taking hits yourself, or flipping through a list with a real clicking feel in the hand.</p>"]},
{"review": ["<p>The design of the iPhone X is very much a mix of old and new. The new parts are obvious: this is a phone with very little bezel, a glass back and no home button.</p>", "<p>But it's also got the familiar rounded shape in the hand \u2013 in fact, it harks back to the days of the iPhone 3G, feeling similar when picked up.</p>", "<p><a class=\"fwd-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-final-cut-pro-x\">Read more: Apple Final Cut Pro X</a></p>", "<p>What you will sense when holding the iPhone X for the first time is that this is a premium handset. It <em>feels </em>expensive, with the weighty steel rim on the outside blending in impressively with the curved glass all around.</p>", "<p>The silver version of the X comes with a polished stainless steel band, while the black option has a similar dark coloring that's been attached through a process called vapor deposition.\u00a0It's also why we may not see a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/product-red-iphone-x\">red iPhone X</a>.</p>", "<p>That means the band\u2019s color isn\u2019t\u00a0painted on... it's inside the metal itself, giving the premium feel we're used to from Apple. A word of warning: after a few days carrying the phone in the pocket, unencumbered by an <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/best-iphone-x-cases\">iPhone X case</a>, we started to see a few examples of scuffing on the rim, so it's worth thinking about putting this in a case, or at the very least a skin, if you want to keep it looking nice.</p>", "<p>While it weighs less than the iPhone 8 Plus (174g compared to 202g), the iPhone X feels a lot heavier in the hand, in a good way.\u00a0</p>", "<p class=\"mid__article\"></p>", "<p>You\u2019ll feel like this is a strong, solidly build handset (and don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s still IP67 water-resistant) and you\u2019d be right \u2013 despite it being glass front and black, Apple believes it's made the strongest iPhone yet.</p>", "<p>We really don't feel that you could bend the iPhone X by sitting on it...</p>", "<p>One negative thing to say about the design: it's a smudge sucker. The outer band gets covered in fingerprints in no time at all, and the glass front and back will happily accept any oil your fingers want to deposit on them.</p>", "<p>And while the rear of the phone is glass, as on the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, there\u2019s a different design language at play with the iPhone X. Every button is elegantly embedded into the rim of the phone, yet there\u2019s a sharpness to each key that comes from them being machined in a certain way.</p>", "<p>The same is true of the protruding camera bump on the rear of the phone \u2013 the edge is sharp, where on the iPhone 8 it rolls into the case. This shows that Apple is taking a new design direction with the X, hinting at the short-term future of iPhone design.</p>", "<p>In terms of how the iPhone X feels in the hand, well, it\u2019s surprisingly easy to use one-handed. It balances naturally in the hand, with the glass and metal combination feeling grippy enough to do so, and most thumbs will be able to roam comfortably over the slippery surface like a little flesh-colored penguin.</p>", "<p>You\u2019ll need to drag down the notifications panel and Control Center with the digits of your other hand on most occasions, but generally the iPhone X is a good mix of phablet-sized screen while being ergonomic enough to use in one hand.</p>", "<p>A special mention to Apple for the way it\u2019s incorporated the speakers into this tightly-packaged phone \u2013 the sound is really something, with full volume making the phone reverberate with audio.</p>", "<p>Despite one of the speakers firing downwards from the bottom of the iPhone X, you can easily listen to movies without headphones \u2013 and the irritated glances from colleagues when we tested out this phone in the office shows that the sound can carry pretty far too.</p>", "<p>There have been reports of a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/dozens-of-iphone-x-users-are-reporting-crackling-speakers\">crackling speaker in some models</a> - however, we've not seen that in the wild and our model was able to crank to full volume with ease.</p>", "<p>In terms of sound, it\u2019s worth reiterating that there\u2019s no headphone jack on the new iPhone range \u2013 Apple has made a big bet that it can convince users to leave their 3.5mm headphones behind for <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/hi-fi-and-audio/headphones/apple-airpods-1328292/review\">AirPods</a>, but it still annoys for now if you don\u2019t have a decent pair of Bluetooth headphone or lose the adapter that comes in the box.</p>"]},
{"review": ["<p><em>Watch our review video outlining the camera on the iPhone X below.</em></p>", "<p>The camera on the iPhone X is very similar to the one on the iPhone 8 Plus, with some small differences.</p>", "<p>For instance, while both have a dual 12MP sensor array (for taking zoomed-in pictures, or capturing depth perception in a scene) the iPhone X has an f/2.4 aperture, where on iPhone 8 Plus it\u2019s f/2.8, and only the wide-angle lens has optical image stabilization.</p>", "<p><a class=\"fwd-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-final-cut-pro-x\">Read more: Apple Final Cut Pro X</a></p>", "<p>It was also been dubbed the best camera on the market by DxOMark, although only for still images, showing the technical prowess of the sensor (it's since we surpassed by the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/huawei-p20-pro-review\">Huawei P20 Pro</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-review\">Samsung Galaxy S9</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-review\">S9 Plus</a>).</p>", "<p>Before we get too far into the performance of the rear camera, let's talk about the front-facing TrueDepth camera, which is a 7MP affair but with some smart capabilities to make the iPhone one of the best selfie-taking cameras on the market.</p>", "<p>The camera, as the name suggests, can sense depth incredibly well, so the new Portrait mode \u2013 debuted on the iPhone 8 Plus \u2013 can be used with the front-facing camera to take excellent selfies.</p>", "<p>Not only will this blur the background, you can also use the Portrait options to change the lighting of the scene, or cut yourself out of the picture altogether and place yourself on a black background.</p>", "<p>The lighting alterations, adding things like contoured lighting to your visage, don't really add a huge amount, and some of the 'stage lighting' pictures that cut you out of the image don't always trace the edges of your head and body perfectly.</p>", "<p>But when it does work, the iPhone X's camera is out of this world \u2013 it delivers stunning shots that are rich with detail, and while it's not the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/best-cameraphone\">best smartphone camera</a> on the market it takes natural-looking photos very well, and that's something a lot of people will celebrate.</p>", "<p>Those pictures look far better on the X\u2019s OLED display too, thanks to the improved contrast ratios and better colors, although sharing the same pictures to an Apple TV shows they\u2019re a little brighter than on the phone screen.</p>", "<p>While the iPhone X is a long way from being the first handset from Apple to use Live Photos, this feature is improved in <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ios-11-release-date-news-and-features\">iOS 11</a> \u2013 being able to loop, bounce or long-expose photos is a fun little extra that you can share with friends well.</p>", "<p>The overall speed of snapping and quality of the iPhone X camera is strong, as you\u2019d expect from a flagship handset from Apple with the new A11 Bionic chip inside.</p>", "<p>Low-light performance is a touch better than from previous iPhones \u2013 although it\u2019s curious the way the iPhone 8 Plus and X have different apertures, yet deliver the same kind of zoomed-in low-light performance.</p>", "<p class=\"mid__article\"></p>", "<p>In real terms, the f/2.4 aperture and optical image stabilization on the zoom lens should mean better low-light photos, but when you\u2019re zoomed in sometimes you\u2019re not actually using the optical lens (which is designed for the task) in favor of\u00a0the more dark-adept 'main' lens.</p>", "<p>This is a good thing. Instead of using the zoomed-in sensor for low-light pictures, the iPhone X uses the wide-angle lens (which has better low light capabilities) and uses \u00a0digital zoom to get the best looking snaps.</p>", "<p>It's hard to say why Apple has bothered to improve the other sensor if this is what it's going to do, but the main thing is picture quality and that's coming through well.</p>", "<p>Some of the shots from the iPhone X are astonishing \u2013 the performance in lower light conditions, when the light is fading, is really strong, although the slower shutter speeds do lead to a touch more noise and blur.</p>", "<p>The camera could do with booting a touch faster from the lock screen (although you can now 3D Touch - push hard - on the photography icon to load the camera, rather than swiping), but generally it\u2019s hard to fault the natural, clear and crisp photos you\u2019ll get from the iPhone.</p>", "<p>The rear Portrait mode is one of the better options on the market, but sometimes it doesn\u2019t quite find the edge of items it\u2019s trying to depth-sense \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-pixel-2-review\">Google Pixel 2</a> actually does it better with a single lens, although the effect on both is sensational when it works correctly.</p>", "<p>It is worth pointing out that \u2018standard\u2019 iPhone pictures have a nice level of background blur automatically, with the focal length automatically finding a nice depth of field for whatever you\u2019re trying to snap.</p>", "<p>Video capabilities on the iPhone X are also among the best on the market, with the 4K recording at 60 frames per second delivering clear, fluid images, albeit images that will take up a fair bit of space on your device.</p>", "<p>If you\u2019re thinking of using the iPhone X as a videographer, you\u2019ll probably want to go for the more expensive 256GB capacity option, as there\u2019s no way to expand the storage here aside from relying on iCloud.</p>"]},

It's pretty good - nothing to write home about but if you've had another Apple handset for a few years you'll be very pleased with how well it lasts during the day.</p>"]},
{"review": ["<p>Let\u2019s get one thing out of the way first: the iPhone X is not a phone for the Android fan. This is a phone for someone who\u2019s entrenched in the iPhone ecosystem and doesn\u2019t want to leave, but has become bored to tears by the same old design from Apple for the last four years.</p>", "<p>The iPhone X is the phone we\u2019ve been willing Apple to make, partly so that we\u2019ve got something new to write about, but also so those who look forward to the arrival of a new iPhone actually have something to get excited about.\u00a0</p>", "<p><a class=\"fwd-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-final-cut-pro-x\">Read more: Apple Final Cut Pro X</a></p>", "<p>\u2018New Phone Day\u2019 is one of the highlights in many people\u2019s years, and the iPhone X is worthy of the excitement.</p>", "<p>Apple has got things almost entirely right with the iPhone X, taking all it\u2019s learned from its past handsets and fusing them together to make a device that\u2019s like nothing else the brand has ever produced.</p>", "<p>See our overview video of the iPhone X below.</p>", "<p>In our opinion, the greatest iPhone before the X was the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/iphone-4-694980/review\">iPhone 4</a>, which elevated Apple from \u2018poor specs but great user experience\u2019 to a real smartphone contender, fusing strong design with decent performance.</p>", "<p>But the iPhone X takes things in a whole new direction, offering users something they\u2019ve never had before in the iOS world. We're annoyed it's taken this long to get an OLED screen on an Apple phone, but now that we've got one there's not a lot to fault on the iPhone X.</p>", "<p>The selfie camera, the raw power, the all-new screen shape and the well-implemented Face ID combine impressively to create a new direction for the iPhone.</p>", "<p>It\u2019s interesting that Apple says the iPhone X is the future of smartphones, however, because many of its new features are already present on other handsets on the market. The X is not going to make waves in the same way the original iPhone did.</p>", "<p>But in terms of the future of iPhones\u2026 well, this is it. Anything that\u2019s not the iPhone X now just looks dated and slathered in bezel. The iPhone X is indeed the Apple handset of the future, and everything else it\u2019s made is history.</p>", "<p>Just think about handing this phone to someone who\u2019s got the first iPhone in 2007 \u2013 that 3.5-inch-screened metal-and-plastic fusion, with a terrible camera, grainy screen, no apps and a swipe to unlock.</p>", "<p>The iPhone X is a smooth, machined, waterproof phone with a superb high-res screen, 256GB of storage, millions of apps, lightning download speeds, AR effects, instant facial recognition, amazing speakers, sublime photos from the front and back cameras, console-level gaming\u2026 the iPhone X serves as powerful reminder to sometimes step back and see how far we\u2019ve come.</p>", "<p>Is it perfect? Of course not \u2013 it's so, so expensive. No matter how good the phone is, the extreme cost puts it out of reach of so many smartphone fans.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The notch on the iPhone X irks, the bezels are a little too heavy to call it bezel-less, the camera isn\u2019t market-leading (although it\u2019s very, very good), and despite all the technical innovation it\u2019s impossible to look past the dizzying cost.</p>", "<p>That said, the iPhone X is the closest to perfection Apple has ever got with an iPhone \u2013 and if you\u2019re okay with the sky-high price, you\u2019re going to love it.</p>", "<p><em>First reviewed October 2017</em></p>", "<p><em>Not sold on the iPhone X?

It\u2019s not quite as powerful in low light as the iPhone X, but it\u2019s certainly capable, and it\u2019s the \u2018next phone down\u2019 on the Apple phone ladder.</p>", "<p>If the iPhone 8 Plus size turns you off, then the iPhone 8 is the one to choose if you want something more manageable in the palm. Both phones have the old-fashioned home button you're used to.</p>", "<p>It\u2019s got all the incredible power of both the iPhone X and the 8 Plus, and while it scrimps on the pixel density of the screen it still has True Tone technology, and the same fast and wireless charging capabilities.</p>", "<p class=\"bordeaux-image-check\"><img src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\" lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image\" onerror=\"this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" sizes=\"auto\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GqLFiaLLhyQx5qcsKu2eAd-320-80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GqLFiaLLhyQx5qcsKu2eAd-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GqLFiaLLhyQx5qcsKu2eAd-650-80.jpg 650w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GqLFiaLLhyQx5qcsKu2eAd.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GqLFiaLLhyQx5qcsKu2eAd.jpg\"></p>", "<p class=\"mid__article\"></p>", "<p>Samsung and Apple are taking cues from each other every new phone cycle, so to be tempted by the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus isn't too surprising. It's a nice phone too.</p>", "<p>If you can get past the switch to Android and handle a phone with a 6.2-inch display, the S9 Plus is our favorite phone at the moment. Its curved Super OLED display and rear-mounted fingerprint sensor make it pleasing in both form and functionality.
