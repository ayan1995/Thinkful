            "<p>The dongle, available now in the U.S. and Canada, is called the <a href=\"https://www.essential.com/audio?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=social_internal&amp;utm_campaign=audioadpterhd&amp;utm_content=learn_more\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.essential.com/audio?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=social_internal&amp;utm_campaign=audioadpterhd&amp;utm_content=learn_more', {metric25:1})\">Audio Adapter HD</a> and attaches magnetically to the back of the PH-1, and uses MQA rendering to deliver better-quality music. Oh, and a three-month trial subscription to Tidal.

            "<p>But Essential itself is not doing very well, and there\u2019s a lot of reasons why it seems it has one foot in the metaphorical grave.

            "<p>Even the dongle has had its own mishaps.

            "<p>The Essential Phone was supposed to be the one. Envisioned by Andy Rubin, the father of Android itself, and expertly crafted from a luxurious combo of ceramic, titanium, and Gorilla Glass, the PH-1 had the kind of pedigree you rarely see from a startup, let alone one that was trying to put out its first phone. But when you look back, aided by the gift of hindsight, it\u2019s clear there was no way Essential could have ever delivered on the hype, especially after a launch plagued by repeated delays, difficulty delivering orders, and unfinished software. And with a price of $700 at launch, when I said the PH-1 was<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-essential-phone-is-too-expensive-to-have-a-camera-t-1798408448\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-essential-phone-is-too-expensive-to-have-a-camera-t-1798408448', {metric25:1})\"> too expensive to have a camera that bad</a>, that wasn\u2019t an opinion, it was fact.</p>",
            "<p>But now, six months later, things have changed. After multiple price drops have brought it down to $500 and ample time to update its software, the PH-1 is, essentially, a different phone now. <br></p>",
            "<p>In the time following its launch, our PH-1 review unit spent much of its time sitting in a drawer. In the fall, Essential was quickly forgotten due to phones like the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/i-hate-how-much-i-love-the-iphone-x-1820086867\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/i-hate-how-much-i-love-the-iphone-x-1820086867', {metric25:1})\">iPhone X</a>, <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/pixel-2-review-google-sticks-to-what-it-does-best-1819557944\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/pixel-2-review-google-sticks-to-what-it-does-best-1819557944', {metric25:1})\">Google\u2019s second Pixel</a>, and the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-note-8-review-bigger-badder-but-i-sti-1799759566#_ga=2.158557823.412381971.1519679128-1282447779.1518012133\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-note-8-review-bigger-badder-but-i-sti-1799759566#_ga=2.158557823.412381971.1519679128-1282447779.1518012133', {metric25:1})\">return of the original big-ass phablet</a> after a two year hiatus. The PH-1 wasn\u2019t really in the same class as those other flagships, to the point that using it as a comparison device didn\u2019t make much sense. But when I pulled it out about a week ago, I couldn\u2019t help but think that the Essential still looks like a dime.<br></p>",
            "<p>Even when viewed side by side with the iPhone X, the PH-1 makes Apple\u2019s ridiculously priced phone look clunky. There\u2019s no awkward camera hump protruding from its back or even a logo to take away from its clean, elegant lines. And in front, the cutout for the PH-1 8-MP selfie cam is both more stylish and less distracting than the iPhone X\u2019s bloated notch\u2014all while delivering a higher screen-to-body ratio than Apple\u2019s handset too. There\u2019s no doubt Essential nailed the design, and I appreciate it more now than I did before.<br></p>",
            "<p>Inside, the PH-1's UI is also spotless, running an unadulterated version of stock Android, which unfortunately remains on Android 7.1 instead of Android 8 Oreo. But the real test is in the phone\u2019s camera app. At launch, on top of delivering soft images with a noticeable lack of detail, the phone often struggled to focus or even snap pics back-to-back in a timely manner. However, over the course of several repeated camera updates, Essential has made some marked improvements. Shutter response is faster, though you\u2019ll still run into a bit of lag every now and then, and focusing speeds are quicker too.</p>",
            "<p>But the most important change is an overall improvement to image quality. After digging up a shot I took with the PH-1 at launch, I went and grabbed the exact same shot now that the phone has had six months of tinkering done to its camera. Even just a passing glance shows how much better the phone has gotten, but when you zoom into 100 percent, it\u2019s obvious. Everything looks sharper and more detailed. Now you can see the texture on the concrete wall, and even colors look more vibrant. And the PH-1 doesn\u2019t look good just when compared to itself either.</p>",
            "<p>In bright light, the PH-1 held its own against a photo captured by a OnePlus 5T. Sure, there are small differences in exposure and white balance, but if you look close, you might even say the OP5T\u2019s pic looks a little soft compared the PH-1. Finally, Essential is putting out pics the can stand up to equally priced competition. However, I do have to point out, this only holds true in well-lit conditions. In low-light, the PH-1 still labors. When I snapped a pic of a nearby plush in my living room with the lights turned down, I was shocked to see how different each phone\u2019s low light pic looked.</p>",
            "<p>And all of this brings us back to pricing. While the phone still has it flaws, at $500, a lot of its quirks, such as its lack of a microSD card slot, wireless charging or any sort of water-resistance, are much more forgivable. So has Essential totally redeemed itself? Definitely, or at least as much as it could in the face of the hyperbolic promises it originally had about revolutionizing the industry.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s not perfect, but it now it finally feels like Essential has something to build on. With a gorgeous body that is somehow more impressive than before, a tidy UI, improved software, and a price that makes sense, the PH-1 has carved out its niche. And even though we can\u2019t quite figure out what\u2019s going on with its new color options, <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/i-cant-tell-what-color-this-phone-is-and-honestly-its-d-1823075408\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/i-cant-tell-what-color-this-phone-is-and-honestly-its-d-1823075408', {metric25:1})\">those look good too</a>.</p>"

            "<p>Making smartphones is hard, and despite having one of the best pedigrees in the business, Andy Rubin\u2019s company stumbled out of the gate when it launched the Essential PH-1 last year. At first, the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-essential-phone-is-too-expensive-to-have-a-camera-t-1798408448\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-essential-phone-is-too-expensive-to-have-a-camera-t-1798408448', {metric25:1})\">Essential Phone\u2019s camera wasn\u2019t great</a> and it\u2019s software wasn\u2019t quite as smooth as we\u2019d like, but thanks to continued support and a some price drops, the PH-1 turned into one of the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-essential-phone-finally-makes-sense-1823185128\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-essential-phone-finally-makes-sense-1823185128', {metric25:1})\">best smartphone bargains of 2018</a>. </p>",
            "<p>So, now that\u2019s Essential\u2019s growing pains are out of the way, the company seems ripe for a successful sophomore followup\u2014right? Not so fast, because according to a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-10/android-creator-is-said-to-build-ai-phone-that-texts-for-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-10/android-creator-is-said-to-build-ai-phone-that-texts-for-you', {metric25:1})\">report from Bloomberg</a>, Essential\u2019s next phone could be anything but conventional. It\u2019s being described as an AI-powered device with a design that \u201csounds a bit like the sci-fi movie <em>Her</em>.\u201d </p>",
            "<p>Bloomberg claims the device will feature a small screen and require users to interact with it primarily using voice controls, while AI-powered software inside handles things like booking appointments and responding to texts and emails automatically\u00a0without additional input from the user.</p>",
            "<p>On top of that, the device is reportedly being designed as a companion gadget that works together with a traditional smartphone instead trying to serve as a full-on replacement for most people. However, this seems like a potentially ruinous move. The whole point of a smartphone is to serve as the sole gadget you need carry around, and trying to convince people to add another brick to their everyday carry could be a very tough sell. </p>",
            "<p>That said, the idea is intriguing. One of the great dreams of technology, and AI in particular, is to help streamline peoples\u2019 lives so they can spend less time responding to constant (and often unnecessary) pings from coworkers, solicitors, and other people jamming up your communication.

        "text": [
            "<p>Jim Jannard is an interesting guy. After starting a one-man business selling motorcycle parts, he decided to pivot into goggles and eyewear. Fast forward about 25 years, and Oakley had become one of the biggest sunglass brands in the world. Then in 2007, after selling Oakley for $2.1 billion, Jannard turned to his other company, and that same year, Red shipped its first 4K<a href=\"https://www.red.com/shot-on-red\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.red.com/shot-on-red', {metric25:1})\"> cinema-grade digital camera</a>. Both companies are highly successful ventures by any definition, so for his third pivot, Jannard thought he would set his sights even higher and make a smartphone unlike anything else on the market. But this time, I think Jim may have gone a little too far because instead of making something you might want to buy, the Red Hydrogen One, with its ambitious 3D display, feels like a phone that teleported from a different dimension.</p>",
            "<p>Crafted from a scalloped aluminum frame and Kevlar panels (a titanium-clad model coming soon), the Hydrogen One looks like a tank and feels even heavier. It has ribbed grooves running down its back and sides that you can grate cheese on, and in back there\u2019s a red jewel surrounded by engraved metal that reads Red Media Machine. All this combines to deliver a kind of rarefied durability, and it\u2019s the first time in a long while I feel like there\u2019s a phone that will never need a case to stay safe. In short, the Hydrogen One is the complete antithesis to the modern glass sandwich smartphone.</p>",
            "<p>But the outlandishness doesn\u2019t stop there, because in addition to a USB-C port for data and charging, the Hydrogen One features a (gasp) headphone jack and a microSD card tray that you can pull out with your fingernail, rather than relying on one of those tiny tray ejector pins that instantly disappears the second you get a new phone. And on its sides, in addition to separate buttons for volume up and down, there\u2019s a lock button on the right with a built-in fingerprint reader and a dedicated camera button\u2014very fitting for a phone made by Red.</p>",
            "<p>All of this is just preamble to the Hydrogen One\u2019s highlight feature: its 4View display. So what does 4View stand for? I\u2019m not totally sure and Red\u2019s website doesn\u2019t exactly spell it out either. But what 4View supposedly delivers is pretty out there. 4View is what Red claims to be the \u201cworld\u2019s first holographic screen,\u201d and its components include all the hottest buzzwords. It\u2019s powered by nanotechnology via a unique Lightfield screen which promises immersive 3D images without the need for glasses. (For those that want to know more about how 4View actually works, check out this interview with one of the creators of the tech <a href=\"https://www.slashgear.com/red-hydrogen-one-phone-display-light-by-leia-interview-23551068/amp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.slashgear.com/red-hydrogen-one-phone-display-light-by-leia-interview-23551068/amp/', {metric25:1})\">here</a>.)</p>",
            "<p>Sadly, those fancy words and added depth don\u2019t come across in normal pictures or videos, which means it\u2019s something that can only be experienced in person. And to me, the Hydrogen One\u2019s display is really just a slightly better version of what you\u2019d get on a new Nintendo 3DS. And it\u2019s true, even without glasses, images do seem to leap off the screen and hover in mid-air, but it\u2019s not the sort of revolutionary display I was expecting to see after over a <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/reds-holographic-media-machine-feels-like-an-april-fool-1796679725\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/reds-holographic-media-machine-feels-like-an-april-fool-1796679725', {metric25:1})\">year</a> of <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/red-s-first-smartphone-still-looks-like-a-fake-star-tre-1802683503\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/red-s-first-smartphone-still-looks-like-a-fake-star-tre-1802683503', {metric25:1})\">hype</a>.</p>",
            "<p class=\"has-video media-large video-embed align--bleed\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" scrolling=\"no\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" data-src=\"/ajax/inset/iframe?id=mcp-3591106&amp;sponsored=false&amp;post_id=1830015204&amp;platform=web&amp;postPosition=0&amp;cloudinaryImageOverride=qhm2kmrdwwqqztme3gth&amp;cloudinaryImageOverrideFormat=JPG\" data-recommend-id=\"mcp://3591106\" height=\"450\" id=\"mcp-3591106\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitAllowFullScreen\" class=\"core-inset lazyload\" width=\"800\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span><span class=\"video-embed__caption\">Watch a bunch of GMG staffers try the Red Hydrogen\u2019s 4View display for the first time.</span></p>",
            "<p>In my opinion, still images using the technology look better than videos, with photos featuring things with hard lines like a sculpture or tree doing the best job of making 4View really pop. But there are still a lot of issues. While in normal 2D mode, the Hydrogen One\u2019s 5.7 4View display is relatively high-res at 2560 x 1440. But when you turn 3D on, you can immediately see that the screen\u2019s resolution is significantly reduced to the point where you can see individual pixels. On top of that, nothing ever looks that sharp, and there\u2019s always a faint rainbow color cast lurking in the background that makes things look more dreamy than real. But I might just be a little jaded, so to get a better sense of what others might think, check out our video to see fellow GMG staffers and their first experience with 4View (check out the video above).</p>",
            "<p>Red knows its 4View display alone wasn\u2019t going to be enough to sell this phone because outside of other Hydrogen One owners sharing pics with each other via the Holopix app or a few other tools, there\u2019s a limited bucket of 3D content to check out. The Hydrogen Network app offers 20 or so movie snippets that you can watch, while the Red Leia Loft app tacks on support for games like but that\u2019s about it. (Oh, AT&amp;T is also giving people who buy a Hydrogen One from them free 4View versions of <em>Ready Player One</em> and <em>Fantastic Beasts</em>). So to help flesh out available 4View content, Red made sure that the Hydrogen One can not only show 3D, it can capture 3D too.</p>",
            "<p>Using the dual cameras in front and back, the Hydrogen can shoot both 3D stills and video, though there are limitations. For the front-facing cams, you can only shoot 3D in portrait orientation, which isn\u2019t actually a big deal. But in back, you are limited to just landscape shots, which is more annoying. Some issues might stem from the tech still being early in its development cycle, such as 4View video recording turning off in the middle of a clip because the phone thinks it\u2019s too bright outside. But even if you can ignore those problems, the Hydrogen\u2019s One\u2019s standard image quality doesn\u2019t impress.</p>",
            "<p>In almost ideal conditions at a well-lit bakery, the Hydrogen One\u2019s camera produced a shot that looked dull, lifeless, and just generally worse than what I got from a Pixel 3. Next, when I shot a picture of some pumpkins, the Hydrogen One struggled with dynamic range, as seen in its blown-out highlights and underexposed details in the shadows. And at night, things got really bad, with the Hydrogen One producing seriously blurry and noisy images repeatedly in multiple locations. Even the phone\u2019s camera app features an awkward UI. To capture 3D pics, you need to hit the 2D button to switch between shooting modes, and to switch into video mode, you need to hit the camera button. It doesn\u2019t really make a lot of sense, and it\u2019s definitely not intuitive. There\u2019s also seemingly no option to show grid lines to help with composition, and while I do appreciate that Red included the ability to display a histogram, that might be the nicest thing I can say about the phone\u2019s camera.</p>",
            "<p>I suppose that after seeing first-time phone makers like <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-essential-phone-is-too-expensive-to-have-a-camera-t-1798408448\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-essential-phone-is-too-expensive-to-have-a-camera-t-1798408448', {metric25:1})\">Essential</a> and <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/razers-powerhouse-phone-for-gamers-is-delightfully-diff-1820817305\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/razers-powerhouse-phone-for-gamers-is-delightfully-diff-1820817305', {metric25:1})\">Razer</a> struggle to nail image quality out of the gate, I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. But given Red\u2019s heritage, I was expecting a much better showing.</p>",
            "<p>Theoretically, all this could be solved through the Hydrogen One\u2019s modular add-on system, which promises to someday let the phone connect to the company\u2019s super expensive cameras, or attach a standalone sensor and third-party lenses from camera makers including Nikon, Canon, Sony, Leica, and others. But those mods don\u2019t exist yet, and there\u2019s no telling when they\u2019ll arrive.</p>",
            "<p>Where things start to get truly ugly though is that for a phone that costs $1,300, its specs are outdated from day one. It\u2019s got a Snapdragon 835 chip from last year, and while 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage are nice, it\u2019s still running Android 8.1, and Red says Android 9 won\u2019t arrive until sometime in 2019. (Currently, its security patch dates back to July, so hopefully, Red addresses that before it goes on sale November 2.) Its LCD display also isn\u2019t very colorful and doesn\u2019t sport the contrast ratios you\u2019d get from a more modern OLED panel. Even the Hydrogen One\u2019s massive 4,500 mAh hour battery is held back by inefficient components, because with a run time of 11:51, Red\u2019s phone lasts an hour or two less than an iPhone XS Max (13:07) or a Galaxy Note 9 (14:11), and is only marginally better than a Pixel 3 XL (11:24).</p>",
            "<p>Ultimately, the Hydrogen One is a very beefy handset with dated internals, no water-resistance or wireless charging, a splashy screen that\u2019s only a bit better than a Nintendo 3DS, and overall image quality that puts Red\u2019s own name to shame. If that doesn\u2019t sound like a phone conjured up in an alternate reality, I don\u2019t know what does. And while there\u2019s still a chance Red can redeem the Hydrogen One and its tech in the future, it\u2019s going to be a long time until a lot of people not named Jim Jannard will really want to own this phone.</p>",
            "<p>Android 8.1 \u2022 Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 \u2022 6GB of RAM \u2022 128GB of storage \u2022 microSD card slot \u2022 2560 x 1440 5.7-inch LCD display \u2022 dual 8-MP front cams \u2022 dual 12-MP rear cams \u2022 Bluetooth 5.0 \u2022 USB-C \u2022 3.5mm jack \u2022 4,500 mAh battery 6.48 x 3.37 x 0.39 inches\u2022 9.27 ounces\u2022 available from AT&amp;T and Verizon \u2022 aluminum version comes in black and gray, titanium model coming soon</p>"

            "<p>Thankfully though, post-launch, Essential didn\u2019t just give up on the PH-1. Instead, the team followed up and improved things like image quality and camera shutter lag.

Suddenly, at $450, the PH-1 could be considered a solid rival to handsets like the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-oneplus-5t-is-very-a-damn-good-phone-for-a-reasonab-1820596179#_ga=2.28617148.1282026341.1534765453-820698127.1522425547\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-oneplus-5t-is-very-a-damn-good-phone-for-a-reasonab-1820596179#_ga=2.28617148.1282026341.1534765453-820698127.1522425547', {metric25:1})\">OnePlus 5T</a> or some of Motorola\u2019s mid-range phones, and depending on the competitor, it featured a noticeably lower price. </p>",
            "<p>Then, earlier this week, the Essential Phone was discounted down to a shocking $224, a ludicrously cheap price so low that we\u2019ve only seen it briefly during <a href=\"https://twitter.com/essential/status/1018918941232525312\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://twitter.com/essential/status/1018918941232525312', {metric25:1})\">Amazon\u2019s most recent Prime day</a> back in July.

Meanwhile, Samsung\u2019s latest phone\u2014the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-note-9-is-the-best-big-phone-1828348138#_ga=2.115146574.875595541.1534766403-r4h5ima09\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-note-9-is-the-best-big-phone-1828348138#_ga=2.115146574.875595541.1534766403-r4h5ima09', {metric25:1})\">$1,000 Galaxy Note 9</a>\u2014launched running Android 8, and if Samsung\u2019s previous update cadence is any indication, it will be at least three months until the device has access to Android 9. </p>",
            "<p>At this point, the price cuts on the Essential Phone have gone way past sensible, and while I know the phrase is overused, for this little money, for $335, the PH-1 really is a steal. It\u2019s got great specs for the price, a spectacularly good build, solid battery life, and after all this, its camera is totally fine now, too. There\u2019s also the PH-1's cool factor, because as the first phone to feature a notch, it deserves its own little spot in annals of smartphone history. </p>",
            "<p>Sure, the Essential Phone itself still has a few issues, such as its missing headphone jack, but sadly, but that\u2019s kind of the norm nowadays. And as for the Essential Phone not having water-resistance or wireless charging, those are features you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find on any other phone in this price range. Really, the Essential Phone\u2019s only legitimate knock is that the whole <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/essential-never-lived-up-to-its-name-and-now-its-repor-1826310798#_ga=2.29842623.1282026341.1534765453-820698127.1522425547\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/essential-never-lived-up-to-its-name-and-now-its-repor-1826310798#_ga=2.29842623.1282026341.1534765453-820698127.1522425547', {metric25:1})\">company might go under or get bought out</a>, at which time, further software support or updates could quickly dry up. This is no small concern. We haven\u2019t heard much about Essential\u2019s fate since May, when Bloomberg reported that it had already \u201ccanceled development\u201d of what would presumably be the Essential Phone 2. But once again, for $335, you could still do so much worse.</p>",
            "<p>So now I ask you, how low would the Essential PH-1 have to go before you\u2019d be willing to buy one\u2014if ever? I might buy one and just keep it in the box, as a reminder of what a wild ride it\u2019s been. </p>"
