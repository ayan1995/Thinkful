{"title": "\n\t\tGoodbye, Essential? Android creator\u2019s startup cuts nearly a third of its staff\t", "author": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChristian de Looper\t\t\t\t\t"], "text": ["<p>Essential, the company founded by Android creator Andy Rubin and known for last year\u2019s Essential Phone, is going through tough times. Just a few days ago news broke that the company was <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/essential-phone-2-news/\">working on an artificial intelligence-powered smartphone</a> that mimics its user, but now, Essential announced it cut around 30 percent of its staff.</p>", "<p>The news isn\u2019t all that surprising. A year and a half after the release of the original Essential Phone, we have yet to see any more major releases from the company. In fact, the company canceled a second Essential Phone and paused development on a new smart speaker, hinting the company had not panned out the way Rubin might have liked.</p>", "<p>News also broke earlier in the year suggesting that Essential was looking to sell the company. That hasn\u2019t happened just yet, but it\u2019s clearly still a possibility.\u00a0According to a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-17/andy-rubin-s-startup-essential-products-cuts-about-30-of-staff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report from Bloomberg</a>, the cuts were primarily made in the hardware and sales divisions of Essential.</p>", "<p>\u201cThis has been a difficult decision to make. We are very sorry for the impact on our colleagues who are leaving the company and are doing everything we can to help them with their future careers,\u201d an Essential spokesperson said in an email to Bloomberg.\u00a0\u201cWe are confident that our sharpened product focus will help us deliver a truly game-changing consumer product.\u201d</p>", "<p>Given the recent news that Essential was working on a new device, the future of the company is very unclear. It seems as though the company could be planning to show off an early prototype of the new device to industry partners at the Consumer Electronics Show in January in Las Vegas, with a release to consumers at some point later in 2019. The device will reportedly feature a small screen and aim to learn its user\u2019s habits so that it can mimic them by doing things like texting back friends for the user. According to reports, the device will mostly be used through voice controls. If that device doesn\u2019t sell \u2014 there\u2019s no guarantee that it will \u2014 it may well be one of the last devices we ever see from Essential.</p>"]},

Patents unearthed by <a href=\"http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2017/05/the-day-after-the-essential-phone-unveiling-we-take-a-peek-at-their-patents-and-a-possible-future-project.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Patently Apple</a> show the startup\u2019s phone plans in full, right down to the device\u2019s magnetic pins that support modular components. They also reveal that Andy Rubin, hailed as the \u201cFather of Android\u201d and now CEO of Essential, could be itching to pick up where Google Glass left off.</p>", "<p>The glasses shown in Essential\u2019s patent look much more like conventional frames than the design Google ultimately ran with. The display is embedded into the lenses, alongside multiple cameras. One faces the user to track their eyes, and the other looks outward to identify objects in the environment. When the latter camera recognizes something it its view, the glasses can present augmented reality overlays relevant to the subject.</p>", "<p>With augmented reality becoming the next great frontier for software developers and hardware producers alike, it\u2019s not totally surprising to learn that Essential has an interest in the space. The company isn\u2019t rushing to the market in its infancy, however. Patents are no guarantee of future retail products, and\u00a0Rubin and company have even publicly admitted that their phone \u2014 which can currently be ordered ahead of \u00a0its release later in June \u2014 is not meant to equal Apple\u2019s iPhone or Samsung\u2019s Galaxy in terms of sales volume.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve gone after technologies and methods of manufacturing that aren\u2019t designed to support 50 million devices,\u201d Jason Keats, the company\u2019s\u00a0head of product architecture, told Wired in an interview.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re not for everybody. You know it\u2019s going to be a little exclusive.\u201d</p>", "<p>So Essential is looking to expand slowly, and you likely won\u2019t see its\u00a0augmented reality plans bear fruit for some time. However, it\u2019s also poised to expand in multiple directions. Those two little pins on the back of the PH-1 are there to\u00a0further the phone\u2019s\u00a0capabilities in ways the company probably hasn\u2019t even fully considered yet. Add that to the development of a Home hub meant to connect a network of disparate devices and Rubin\u2019s creation of Playground, a startup accelerator firm, and it\u2019s clear Essential\u2019s vision doesn\u2019t stop at what we learned this week.</p>", "<p>Whether it will include these glasses is anyone\u2019s guess.</p>"]},

The edge-to-edge display is stunning, it performs well, and we like pure Android, but there were some teething troubles. Now that the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/essential-phone-news/\">price has dropped</a>, and the camera has been updated, it\u2019s a more tempting prospect than ever.</p>", "<p>If you do buy one, then you\u2019ll want to consider snagging one of the best Essential Phone cases to protect it. Sadly, that may be easier said than done, because case manufacturers haven\u2019t exactly rushed to market with a bevy of great cases to choose from.

It\u2019s made from a special polymer blend that offers real durability without adding too much bulk. You can expect reliable drop protection up to 3 feet, ideal for your typical hand height drop. It\u2019s a perfect fit with generous cut-outs for easy camera and fingerprint sensor access on the back and port access on the bottom. Well-defined button covers and a protective lip around the screen complete this reliable case.

The fit is good, and it shows off the <a href=\"https://www.essential.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Essential Phone</a> well, but we think drop protection is going to be pretty minimal.

{"title": "\n\t\t10 Home Office Essentials\t", "author": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAndrew Beehler\t\t\t\t\t"], "text": ["<p>More and more people are working from home: some telecommute for their paid job, some own their own home-based businesses and some use their home offices as super-charged productivity hubs for all  their jobs, clients, paid hobbies and more. The one thing all home offices have in common is that they should all be geared up and streamlined for distraction-free, enjoyable productivity. We\u2019ve  got a quick list of some essential tech items that can help you work smarter, not just harder. Some of these items may even save you a bunch of money.</p>", "<p><strong>1. All-in-One or Multifunction Machine</strong><br>\n In the not-so-distant past, home offices typically had a veritable flotilla of devices to help keep things running \u2013 a printer, a scanner, a copier and a fax machine. Thank the geek gods for  constantly improving technology, because all those old devices fit into one slim, high tech machine. All-in-One units have high quality color printers, high-resolution scanners, copy functions and  can even fax when plugged into a phone line. If you don\u2019t have a dedicated land-line for faxing, just scan a document and fax it for free using <a href=\"http://www.faxzero.com\">faxzero.com</a>. An  All-in-One is essential because it does so much and takes up so little space. You\u2019ll also save a lot on your electricity bills by dropping from four power-hungry devices to one.</p>", "<p><strong>Some popular All-in-One units:</strong></p>", "<p>A) <a href=\"http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16828104515\">HP Photosmart C6180\u00a0<br>\n</a>B) <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Brother-DCP-7020-Digital-Copier-Printer/dp/B0007PF7GU?tag=digitren08-some-20\">Brother DCP-7020</a> <br>\n C) <a href=\"http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16828104049\">HP LaserJet 3055</a></p>", "<p><strong>2. Laptop Computer</strong><br>\n Laptop computers are often preferred for home-office use because they allow work to be done from more than one static location in the home. They can be moved from desk to desk, out of the office  and onto the porch, and even on the road if ever necessary. Should you get a little stir-crazy from working from the same location all the time, a quick trip to a coffee house with wireless  internet can work wonders for clearing cobwebs, sparking new ideas and reminding you that you\u2019re still part of a social society. You just can\u2019t get that freedom with a desktop computer. Laptops use  much less power than desktops, so you could see an almost instant drop in power consumption.</p>", "<p><strong>Some popular laptops:</strong></p>", "<p>A) <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macbook\">MacBook</a> <br>\n B) <a href=\"http://reviews.digitaltrends.com/review4745.html\">Lenovo ThinkPad T61p\u00a0<br>\n</a>C) <a href=\"http://reviews.digitaltrends.com/review4671.html\">HP Pavilion HDX </a></p>", "<p><strong>3. External Hard Drive</strong><br>\n If you value any of the data on your computer, you need to keep it backed up in some way or another. If you have lots of data to protect (images, spreadsheets, business plans, computer code,  emails, etc.), you\u2019ll want a very reliable external hard drive. Storing duplicates of your files on an external drive saves you untold grief should your main computer ever fail or go missing.  Always buy a hard drive that can hold more data than you think you\u2019ll need. You can often get drives with 200% more storage room for only 10% to 20% higher prices than base models. Excellent value,  brilliant security solution.</p>", "<p><strong>Some popular external hard drives:</strong></p>", "<p>A) <a href=\"http://reviews.digitaltrends.com/review4795.html\">Maxtor OneTouch 4 Mini</a> \u2013 small, fast and easy\u00a0<br>\n B) <a href=\"http://reviews.digitaltrends.com/review4818.html\">LaCie 2big Triple RAID</a> \u2013 for super safe, hardcore backups\u00a0<br>\n C) <a href=\"http://www.lacie.com/us/products/product.htm?pid=10894\">LaCie d2 quadra</a></p>", "<p><strong>4. Spacious LCD Screen</strong><br>\n If you\u2019re one of the few people still using a bulky CRT monitor in your home office, please, please, please do yourself and the environment a favor by upgrading to a new LCD monitor. New LCD  screens offer stunning visual quality, low power consumption and, best of all, widescreen LCDs can enhance productivity. Even if you\u2019re using a laptop, you can benefit immensely from the  productivity boost an external LCD monitor can provide. It essentially doubles your work space, allowing you to multitask like mad, all without having to switch back and forth between super tiny  windows. Prices are right for any budget, too.</p>", "<p><strong>Some popular LCD screens:</strong> <br>\n A) <a href=\"http://reviews.digitaltrends.com/review4452.html\">HP w2007 20\u2033 widescreen LCD</a> <br>\n B) <a href=\"http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824001096\">Samsung 226BW 22\u2033 widescreen LCD\u00a0<br>\n</a>C) <a href=\"http://reviews.digitaltrends.com/review4799.html\">HP  w2408 24\u2033 widescreen LCD</a></p>", "<p><strong>5. Speaker System<br>\n</strong> Unless you\u2019re hearing impaired or suffer from terribly low attention span, one of the most enjoyable productivity boosters can be background music. Whether  it\u2019s a little Tony Bennett playing softly over the air waves, or trip-hop cranked up loud enough to drown out air raid sirens, music is both aesthetic and therapeutic. Luckily, high quality speaker  systems are very affordable and can play directly from your computer or MP3 player. Desktop systems, shelf systems and even floor-based systems can be found online and in retail stores everywhere.  Speaker sets may not save you any money, but the music they play can inspire you to do more.</p>", "<p><strong>Some popular speaker systems:</strong> <br>\n A) <a href=\"http://reviews.digitaltrends.com/review4840.html\">mStation 2.1 Stereo Tower</a> <br>\n B) <a href=\"http://reviews.digitaltrends.com/review3906.html\">Audioengine A5</a> <br>\n C) <a href=\"http://reviews.digitaltrends.com/review4447.html\">XtremeMac Tango</a></p>", "<p><strong>6. Comfortable Keyboard</strong><br>\n Whether you\u2019re using a desktop or laptop computer, the wrong keyboard can wreak havoc on your work flow and can prematurely tire your hands and fingers. Bad keyboards contribute to typos,  hand/wrist strain and, quite often, excessively loud key noise that can drive some people batty. Find a new keyboard that has smooth keying action that feels good under the tips of your fingers.  Ergonomic keyboards can help reduce and/or prevent strain. Most high-quality keyboards have wireless versions, helping you keep your desk clutter free.</p>", "<p><strong>Some popular keyboards:</strong> <br>\n A) <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000A6QSLE?tag=digitren-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B000A6QSLE&amp;adid=0PV7BVKC4RWYQ0Y0CHMK&amp;=\">Microsoft Natural  Ergonomic Keyboard 4000</a> <br>\n B) <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000AY5ZIS?tag=digitren-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B000AY5ZIS&amp;adid=1GNX16P16WM1YCTSVMEG&amp;=\">Logitech Cordless Desktop  MX 5000 Laser</a> (Keyboard/Mouse Combo)<br>\n C) <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000E204LY?tag=digitren-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B000E204LY&amp;adid=059QFSTA9P4RXTAABXYA&amp;=\">Cordless Desktop S 530  Laser for Mac</a> (Keyboard/Mouse Combo)</p>", "<p><strong>7. Better Mouse</strong><br>\n Old style mice with the rubber ball underneath are notoriously bad when it comes to accurate mouse movements. No matter how clean you or your work space may be, gunk inevitably builds up, causing  herky jerky, uncontrollable mouse action. They\u2019re also prime gathering places for nasty germs. An optical or laser mouse will work beautifully on most surfaces, and you can even ditch the nasty  mouse pad. Some mice are made with comfortable ergonomic designs, making them very pleasant to use for long periods of time. Wireless mice (whether Bluetooth or RF) are great for keeping desks  clean and tidy.</p>", "<p>Some popular mice:\u00a0<br>\n A) <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000CRGCSK?tag=digitren-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B000CRGCSK&amp;adid=0TGX1D3B76CFK694TVYD&amp;=\">Microsoft Wireless Optical  Mouse 4.0 Mass Steel Blue<br>\n</a>B) <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000H5DF32?tag=digitren-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B000H5DF32&amp;adid=0YCMYXZCZKNSBYNZF6M2&amp;=\">Logitech MX400 Performance Laser  Mouse</a><br>\n C) <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EXRSWG?tag=digitren-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B000EXRSWG&amp;adid=1C26YVNA21TF9PSA7FQV&amp;=\">Logitech MX610 Left-Hand  Laser Cordless Mouse</a></p>", "<p><strong>8. Cell Phone &amp; VoIP Headsets</strong><br>\n In a work environment, cell phone headsets can be invaluable. Whether corded or wireless, headsets allow extra mobility, eliminate kinked-neck syndrome and add freedom for both hands to work on  other things. Bluetooth headsets allow you to freely walk around the office environment, up to 30 feet from the phone itself. Most Bluetooth headsets (and many corded headsets) also work well with  VoIP applications like Skype, iChat, etc.</p>", "<p>Some popular headsets:\u00a0<br>\n A) <a href=\"http://reviews.digitaltrends.com/review4678.html\">Plantronics Voyager 520</a> (for cell phones &amp; computers)\u00a0<br>\n B) <a href=\"http://reviews.digitaltrends.com/review4374.html\">Aliph Jawbone</a> (for cell phones &amp; computers)\u00a0<br>\n C) <a href=\"http://reviews.digitaltrends.com/review4389.html\">Plantronics .Audio 550 DSP</a> (for cell phones &amp; VoIP applications)</p>", "<p><strong>9. VoIP Phone Service</strong><br>\n Standard land-lines, though old-school, are commonly used for home office phone service. Many home-based entrepreneurs and remote employees use cell phones, especially if they need to be mobile on  a regular basis. Another fantastic option \u2013 often free or incredibly inexpensive \u2013 is to use an already-existing high speed Internet connection for VoIP \u2013 also known as Voice over Internet  Protocol, or internet telephony. Think <a href=\"http://www.skype.com\">Skype</a> and <a href=\"http://www.vonage.com\">Vonage</a>. These services can save tens, hundreds and even thousands of dollars  on long distance and long-duration calls. Skype offers a $30/year USD plan called \u201cSkype Unlimited\u201d which allows you to place any number of calls from your computer to any US telephone  number for only $30 USD per year. You can talk 24/7/365 and not pay a penny more than $30. Inbound calls to your special Skype phone number, however, cost about $60 USD per year \u2013 still, very  inexpensive. Vonage has personal and business plans that allow you to use any standard phone connected to a little router than ties into your high-speed Internet service. \u201cResidential Premium  Unlimited\u201d costs $25 USD per month and \u201cSmall Business Premium Unlimited\u201d (with a phone number AND fax number) costs $50 USD per month. That\u2019s a major savings over land-line costs.  Both Skype and Vonage offer voicemail services.</p>", "<p><strong>10. Charging Station</strong><br>\n Along with all the gadgets sprawled all over the average home office desk, there are inevitably an equal number of charging blocks and cords connected to said gadgetry. Virtually eliminate the mess  by getting a super charging hub like the \u201c<a href=\"http://callpod.com/products/chargepod\">Callpod Chargepod</a>\u201c. The Chargepod can simultaneously charge up to six gadgets and only uses  one wall outlet. It\u2019s a fantastic space saver in the home office, and works wonders for simplifying business and personal travel and lightening the bags you may carry.</p>"]},

But just how do the two phones compare? We put them head to head to find out.</p>", "<p>The Essential Phone makes use of the latest and greatest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, and it\u2019s coupled with 4GB of RAM.

The iPhone 7 Plus will prove to be an extremely smooth device. In fact, when it comes to benchmarks, the Essential PH-1 <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/review/355633/essential-phone-ph-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">scored</a>\u00a0161,746 on AnTuTu, while the Apple iPhone 7 Plus scored a hefty\u00a0181,807 \u2014 putting the Essential PH-1 to shame.

It has the same processor as phones like the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8-review/\">Samsung Galaxy S8</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/htc-u11-review/\">HTC U11</a>. It\u2019s a high-performing phone, and will last you at least a few years of use. Benchmarks aren\u2019t the best indicator of real-world use.</p>", "<p>If you\u2019re looking for a lot of storage, both phones have a lot to offer. Neither have a MicroSD card slot, but the iPhone 7 Plus has options for 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB of storage, while the Essential Phone comes only with 128GB of storage.</p>", "<p>Both of these phones will perform well, but the iPhone 7 Plus is technically the better performer.</p>", "<p><strong>Winner: Apple iPhone 7 Plus</strong></p>", "<p>Both of these phones feature beautiful designs, but in very different ways.</p>", "<p>For starters, the Essential PH-1 boasts a beautiful 5.71-inch edge-to-edge display, which covers almost the entire front of the phone save for a small notch at the top and a chin at the bottom. The back of the phone is shiny and minimal. You\u2019ll find a fingerprint sensor here, below a dual-camera module and a few other sensors.</p>", "<p>The iPhone 7 Plus is also well-designed, though a little less groundbreaking than the Essential Phone. On the front, the 5.5-inch display sits above Apple\u2019s Touch ID fingerprint sensor and home button. The design does look a little dated thanks to the chunky edges surrounding the screen. The rear is minimal like the Essential Phone, with the iconic Apple logo and a dual-camera module above.</p>", "<p>Things are a little different when it comes to the display \u2014 the Essential Phone is the clear winner. Despite an LCD screen, you get a 2,560 x 1,312 pixel resolution, which is quite a bit more than the 1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution on the Apple iPhone 7 Plus. You also get more screen in a smaller, lighter package with the Essential Phone.</p>", "<p>But the iPhone takes the crown for durability, as it has a waterproof rating of IP67, meaning you can take it up to 1 meter underwater for 30 minutes. The Essential Phone isn\u2019t waterproof.</p>", "<p>Still, the Essential Phone features a more modern design, along with a higher resolution display. It takes the win here.</p>", "<p><strong>Winner: Essential PH-1</strong></p>", "<p>The battery on the iPhone 7 Plus sits in at 2,900mAh, while the Essential PH-1 offers a 3,040mAh battery. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the PH-1 will last longer \u2014 the device has a much higher-resolution display, which means that it will be much more taxing on the battery. Still, early <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/essential-phone-reviews-roundup/\">reviews</a> suggest the PH-1 has pretty decent battery life. We\u2019ll do more testing to confirm.</p>", "<p>While the Essential Phone offers fast-charging, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus does not. Because of that, at least on paper, the Essential PH-1 is the winner here.</p>", "<p><strong>Winner: Essential PH-1</strong></p>", "<p>The two phones have dual-camera setups, but they have slightly different specifications. The iPhone 7 Plus offers a dual 12-megapixel sensor with an f/1.8 aperture and optical image stabilization on the primary lens, and the PH-1 has a dual 13-megapixel sensor with an f/1.9 aperture.</p>", "<p>Apple has long been known for offering an excellent camera on its devices, and the iPhone 7 Plus is no different. In <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-7-plus-review/\">our review</a>, we hailed the dual-camera setup especially the benefit of having a 2x optical zoom. Apple also introduced Portrait Mode a few months later via a software update, and it offers DSLR-like quality portrait images.</p>", "<p>Some early reviews suggest the Essential PH-1\u2019s camera could be just as good. The device\u2019s dual-cameras feature a monochrome and a color sensor. The camera doesn\u2019t feature some of the dual-sensor features found on the iPhone, like Portrait Mode or HDR.</p>", "<p>The iPhone\u2019s camera is tried and true. While some early reviews say that the PH-1\u2019s camera is great, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/08/review-essential-phone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">others</a> don\u2019t quite agree.</p>", "<p><strong>Winner: Apple iPhone 7 Plus</strong></p>", "<p>Before we talk about software, we\u2019ll say one thing \u2014 we\u2019re not going to award a winner here. The <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-smartphone-os/\">Android vs iPhone</a> debate is a long-running one, and everyone has their own preference.</p>", "<p>Still, we can note some major differences between the two operating systems. Android is generally known to offer more customization, while iOS is easier to use. Essential offers a pure Android experience, similar to what you will find on the Google Pixel. It\u2019s free of bloatware, unlike some Android devices.</p>", "<p><strong>Winner: Tie</strong></p>", "<p>The Essential PH-1 is available for purchase, and you can get your hands on it through the Essential website, <a href=\"https://www.sprint.com/shop/device/essential-phone-preorder-128gb-black-moon?skuId=113100399&amp;duration=18L&amp;contractType=lease&amp;lineId=175448970\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sprint</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/essential-essential-phone-4g-lte-with-128gb-memory-cell-phone-unlocked-pure-white/5973001.p?skuId=5973001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Best Buy</a>. It doesn\u2019t seem as though other carriers are offering the phone, and there\u2019s no word yet on whether they will or not. We recommend buying the phone unlocked straight from Essential. The device cost $700, which is a premium price to pay for a phone.</p>", "<p>The Apple iPhone 7 Plus is slightly more expensive, though it\u2019s available more widely. It costs $770 for the 32GB version, and you can get it from all four major carriers, unlocked from the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple website</a>, Amazon, Best Buy, and so on.</p>", "<p><strong>Winner: Essential PH-1</strong></p>", "<p>Both the Essential PH-1 and Apple iPhone 7 Plus are excellent phones, but the Essential\u2019s gorgeous edge-to-edge design and slightly lower price gives it the win here. The iPhone is technically more powerful and seems to offer a slightly better camera, but the PH-1 likely has a better battery and can charge back up quickly.</p>"]},

This time around, OnePlus has made a few big tweaks to the phone\u2019s design, bringing a nice, edge-to-edge display to the device.</p>", "<p>Of course, there are other phones in the price range with an even more edge-to-edge display, like the Essential Phone, which made a splash in the Android world earlier this year, and just recently got a pretty big price cut to $500. That puts it in direct competition with the OnePlus 5T. But which phone is better? We put the two head-to-head to find out.</p>", "<p>Both the Essential Phone and the OnePlus 5T feature Qualcomm\u2019s latest and greatest chip, the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/qualcomm-snapdragon-835-benchmarks/\">Qualcomm Snapdragon 835</a>, but that\u2019s about where the similarities in specs end. The OnePlus 5T features either 6GB or 8GB of RAM, and either 64GB or 128GB of storage, depending on the model you choose. The Essential Phone, on the other hand, only offers 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Neither of the two devices offer a MicroSD card slot, so you\u2019ll want to get as much storage as you need up front.</p>", "<p>There\u2019s a bit of a trade-off here. The base model of the Essential Phone offers a lot more storage than the base model of the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/oneplus-5t-release-date-price-specs-news/\">OnePlus 5T</a>, but the OnePlus offers more RAM in both situations. Now, for day to day use that probably isn\u2019t going to mean much to you \u2014 but it does mean that the OnePlus will get a slight performance boost over the Essential Phone for mulititasking.</p>", "<p>Because of the extra RAM and the fact that you can get just as much storage on the OnePlus 5T, it\u2019s the winner here.</p>", "<p><strong>Winner: OnePlus 5T</strong></p>", "<p>OnePlus has made a few design tweaks for the OnePlus 5T, overall giving it a much more modern look. The design now includes a so-called \u201cedge-to-edge\u201d display, which has also resulted in the fingerprint sensor being moved to the back. It\u2019s a pretty good look, despite the fact that there\u2019s still a forehead and chin on the phone that some may not like. That\u2019s unlike the Essential Phone, which features a true edge-to-edge display. It\u2019s so edge-to-edge, that there\u2019s a small cutout at the top for the phone\u2019s front-facing camera. Like the OnePlus 5T, the Essential Phone does have a fingerprint sensor on the back, along with a dual-sensor camera.</p>", "<p>One major point of difference to keep in mind is the fact that the OnePlus 5T has a headphone jack, while the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/essential-phone-review/\">Essential Phone</a> does not.</p>", "<p>When it comes to the display, the two phones are very different. The Essential Phone features a 5.7-inch LCD display, while the OnePlus 5T\u2019s display comes in at 6-inches and is an AMOLED display. The trade-off, however, is resolution \u2014 while the OnePlus 5T\u2019s resolution comes in at 2160 x 1080 pixels, the Essential Phone steps things up to 2560 x 1312 pixels \u2014 and the slightly smaller size makes it a much sharper, pixel-dense display.</p>", "<p>Neither of the two phones offer water-resistance of any kind, and you\u2019ll want to be careful to not drop them, as the large screens are likely prone to shattering.</p>", "<p>Because of the more edge-to-edge display and higher resolution, the Essential Phone is the winner here.</p>", "<p><strong>Winner: Essential Phone</strong></p>", "<p>With a higher resolution comes a tax on battery life, and the fact that the Essential Phone has a smaller battery to begin with could well amplify that. The device offers a 3,040mAh battery, while the OnePlus 5T\u2019s battery comes in at 3,300mAh. The OnePlus 5T also has OnePlus\u2019 Dash Charge, which has consistently been rated among the best fast-charging technologies available. The <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/essential-phone-news/\">Essential Phone</a> doesn\u2019t offer Qualcomm\u2019s QuickCharge tech, but it can <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/essential/comments/71hcn5/psa_our_phones_are_not_qualcomm_quick_charge/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">get fast charging</a> through USB-C PowerDelivery, providing you have the right chargers.</p>", "<p>Because of the larger battery and better fast charging tech, the OnePlus 5T is the winner here.</p>", "<p><strong>Winner: OnePlus 5T</strong></p>", "<p>The OnePlus 5T offers a dual 16MP and 20MP camera, with an aperture of f/1.7, phase detection autofocus, and a dual-LED flash. Those are pretty decent specs \u2014 but as any photographer would know, specs alone don\u2019t make for great performance. The Essential Phone\u2019s camera, on the other hand, comes in with a dual 13MP sensor with an aperture of f/1.9. It also has both phase and laser detection autofocus, and an LED flash.</p>", "<p>So which camera is better? Well, we\u2019ve extensively reviewed both of these phones, and the OnePlus 5T offers both better photos and an easier camera experience. In our review of the OnePlus 5T, we found that while the camera isn\u2019t on par with the likes of the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-2-review/\">Google Pixel 2</a>, it\u2019s still very good. We found that the Essential Phone\u2019s camera did take decent shots, but still not as good as the OnePlus 5T, and the app was a little frustrating to use too.</p>", "<p><strong>Winner: OnePlus 5T</strong></p>", "<p>Both of these phones offer a pretty stock Android experience, which we see as a good thing. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s totally stock. The OnePlus 5T offers OnePlus\u2019 OxygenOS, which is currently based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat \u2014 though an upgrade to Android 8.0 Oreo is on the way. Small tweaks include things like more features in the camera app, and Face Unlock \u2014 a feature similar to the iPhone\u2019s Face ID.</p>", "<p>The Essential Phone, on the other hand, offers pretty much stock Android, with only a few tweaks to optimize the display for the notch at the top of the phone. That means that the phone gets pretty quick updates, and in fact recently started its beta for <a href=\"https://www.android.com/versions/oreo-8-0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Android 8.0 Oreo</a>. The OnePlus 5T beta for Oreo will be coming a little later this year.</p>", "<p>Because of the faster updates, the Essential Phone is the winner.</p>", "<p><strong>Winner: Essential Phone</strong></p>", "<p>The phones are in the same price bracket \u2014 and they both offer excellent value for money. The Essential Phone has been available for some time now, and can be bought for $500 from <a href=\"https://shop.essential.com/products/phone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Essential</a> or from <a href=\"https://www.sprint.com/en/shop/cell-phones/essential-phone.html?ensembleId=ESS2ALBBBLK&amp;credit=A2&amp;contractName=0-yr-lb-18months&amp;deviceQuantity=1&amp;plan=pln10660000prd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sprint</a>.</p>", "<p>The OnePlus 5T is also now available \u2014 and the base model costs $500, while the 8GB RAM version comes in at $560. It\u2019s available <a href=\"https://oneplus.net/5t\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">from OnePlus</a>.</p>", "<p>The phones come in at the same price for the base model, so this one\u2019s a tie.</p>", "<p><strong>Winner Tie</strong></p>", "<p>The design and edge-to-edge display on the Essential Phone are nice, but they\u2019re not enough to beat the OnePlus 5T\u2019s better performance, camera, and battery. Those are all major features of a phone, and most people will find them important.</p>", "<p>That doesn\u2019t mean the Essential Phone is a bad choice. In fact, it\u2019s still an excellent option. The difference between these phones is seriously minimal, and if you prefer the design of the Essential Phone and want a higher-resolution display, then it may be the better option for you. For an all-around great phone, however, you\u2019ll want to get the OnePlus 5T.</p>"]},

It\u2019s got an edge-to-edge screen with a unique cutout around the front camera, a durable titanium frame, and a snap-on accessory system that supports a 360-degree camera module.</p>", "<p>But there\u2019s plenty of competition. The Essential Phone is going up against Samsung\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8-review/\">Galaxy S8</a>, one of the best smartphones on the market. So just how does it fare? Read on for a full Essential Phone vs. Galaxy S8 comparison.</p>", "<p>In terms of raw hardware, the Essential Phone and Galaxy S8 are evenly matched.</p>", "<p>Both phones sport Qualcomm\u2019s octa-core <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/qualcomm-snapdragon-835-benchmarks/\">Snapdragon 835</a> processor paired with 4GB of RAM, but storage is a different story. The Galaxy S8 has 64GB of internal memory and a MicroSD Card slot that can accommodate cards up to 2TB in size, while the Essential Phone comes with 128GB of internal storage and no MicroSD Card slot.</p>", "<p>Essential\u2019s decision to ditch the MicroSD Card slot might upset folks who\u2019ve invested in removable storage, but you get double the base storage from the S8. Plus, it\u2019s rare to find a 128GB smartphone at the Essential\u2019s price point in the U.S., so we\u2019re giving it the win here. If a MicroSD card slot is important to you, then the S8 is for you.</p>", "<p><strong>Winner: Essential Phone</strong></p>", "<p>The Essential Phone has a titanium body that\u2019s shielded with ceramic. The screen, a 5.71-inch LCD with a 19:10 aspect ratio, stretches the entire length of the front, and has distinctive cutout near the top that curves around the selfie camera. There aren\u2019t any physical buttons on the front or back, and just a tiny chin on the bottom.</p>", "<p>The glass-and-metal Galaxy S8 is a lot curvier. Samsung\u2019s Infinity Display tapers off around the phone\u2019s edges, maximizing screen real estate. There aren\u2019t any physical buttons on the front either. The two embrace the bezel-less trend in smartphones, and since design is largely subjective, we\u2019re not awarding a win here.</p>", "<p>But the Galaxy S8 is the more durable of the two on paper. It\u2019s IP68 certified for water- and dust-resistance, which means it can survive a five-foot pool of water for up to half an hour. The Essential Phone isn\u2019t, but in fairness, its titanium frame will likely hold up well against sidewalks and hardwood floors.</p>", "<p>The Galaxy S8 takes the cake in terms of display technology. The Essential Phone\u2019s LCD screen has good viewing angles and brightness, but it doesn\u2019t match the vibrancy of the Galaxy S8\u2019s Super AMOLED. It\u2019s also less sharp: The Essential Phone has a 2,560 x 1,312-pixel resolution, compared to the Galaxy S8\u2019s Quad HD+ 2,960 x 1,440.</p>", "<p><strong>Winner: Galaxy S8</strong></p>", "<p>On paper, there\u2019s not a huge difference between the Galaxy S8 and the Essential Phone in the battery department. The Galaxy S8 has a 3,000mAh battery, and the Essential Phone has a slightly bigger 3,040mAh battery. Both have the same power-efficient Snapdragon processor, but the S8\u2019s screen likely draws a little more power.</p>", "<p>The Essential Phone and Galaxy S8 support different flavors of fast charging. The S8 has Samsung\u2019s Adaptive Fast Charge, which takes about an hour to fully juice. But the Galaxy S8 also supports <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-wireless-phone-chargers/\">wireless charging</a> (in the Qi and PMA format), which the Essential Phone doesn\u2019t, so we\u2019re giving it the win.</p>", "<p><strong>Winner: Galaxy S8</strong></p>", "<p>The Essential Phone has dual rear cameras on the back, one 13-megapixel monochrome sensor and one 13-megapixel full-color sensor. Custom camera software combines the data to boost color accuracy and improve low-light performance, and Essential says that in a future software update, the phone will gain the ability to shoot in HDR (high-dynamic range) and a DSLR-like bokeh mode (think the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-7-review/\">iPhone 7\u2019s</a> <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-ios-10-1-portrait-mode/\">Portrait Mode</a>).</p>", "<p>The S8 makes do with a single 12-megapixel rear camera, but offers a software setting, Selective Focus, that approximates the bokeh effect.</p>", "<p>Samsung\u2019s camera is great, but there\u2019s something to be said for the Essential Phone\u2019s forthcoming features. Selective Focus does a decent job artificially blurring backgrounds most of the time, but capturing true depth of field requires the Essential\u2019s camera hardware.</p>", "<p>When it comes to the front camera, the Essential Phone and Galaxy S8 are neck-and-neck \u2014 both have an 8-megapixel selfie cam that can shoot video in 2K.</p>", "<p><strong>Winner:</strong> <strong>Essential Phone</strong></p>", "<p>The Essential Phone and Galaxy S8 both run Android, but the former has a version that\u2019s extremely close to Google\u2019s pure Android. There isn\u2019t much customization to speak of, and it\u2019s pre-loaded with mostly Google apps. It\u2019s about as close as you can get a <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-review/\">Pixel</a> without buying a Pixel.</p>", "<p>The Galaxy S8, on the other hand, runs the latest version of Samsung\u2019s TouchWiz skin. It\u2019s chock full of features like <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-use-bixby/\">Bixby</a>, Samsung\u2019s digital assistant, and Activity Zone, which puts handy utilities like a stopwatch, barometer, compass, and flashlight at your fingertips.</p>", "<p>So which offers the better experience? It\u2019s a matter of personal preference, really. Some people might find the S8\u2019s TouchWiz more obnoxious than helpful, while others find the Essential Phone\u2019s software a little too bare bones. Personally, we\u2019re fans of the latter. The Essential Phone might not have all the S8\u2019s bells and whistles, but it\u2019s not overstuffed with features you\u2019ll never use.</p>", "<p><strong>Winner:</strong> <strong>Essential Phone</strong></p>", "<p>One of the Essential Phone\u2019s biggest draws is its fancy accessory system. On the back of the phone are magnetic pins that snap to modular add-ons like cameras, batteries, and more. It\u2019s like your computer\u2019s USB port, but far more powerful.</p>", "<p>So far, there\u2019s only one accessory available for the Essential Phone: A 360-degree camera. It can capture video in resolutions up to 4K at 30FPS, and weighs just 35 grams.\u00a0Essential says it will release a new accessory \u201cevery few months,\u201d but it remains to be seen whether or not third parties will support it.</p>", "<p>The Galaxy S8 doesn\u2019t have that problem \u2014 Samsung\u2019s flagship has an abundance of accessories. One is the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-dex-first-impressions-review/\">Dex Dock</a>, a hockey puck-like device that transforms the Galaxy S8 into a full-blown desktop. Another is <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/phones/wireless-charging-pad-black-sapphire-ep-pg920ibugus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Samsung\u2019s Wireless Charging Pad</a>, which can rapidly charge the Galaxy S8 in minutes flat. Samsung also has the Gear 360 camera, as well as the Gear VR for mobile virtual reality.</p>", "<p><strong>Winner:</strong> <strong>Galaxy S8</strong></p>", "<p>At $700 for the Essential Phone and $750 for the Galaxy S8, the two phones are pretty close in pricing. But availability is a different story.</p>", "<p>The Essential Phone is only available from <a href=\"https://www.essential.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Essential\u2019s website</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/essential-essential-phone-4g-lte-with-128gb-memory-cell-phone-unlocked-pure-white/5973001.p?skuId=5973001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Best Buy</a>, and one carrier, <a href=\"https://www.sprint.com/en/landings/essential-phone.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sprint</a>, though Essential says that the phone supports every major carrier in the U.S. Contrast that with the Galaxy S8, which is available from Verizon, AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile.</p>", "<p>If you order from Essential, for a limited time you can get both the phone and 360-degree camera for $750.</p>", "<p>Sprint\u2019s offering a substantial leasing discount on the Essential Phone too \u2014 as long as you don\u2019t mind the black model. Customers pay only $14.58 a month for a year and half, which amounts to a $260 savings. You\u2019ll have to pay the remaining balance on the phone\u2019s $700 if you want to keep it at the end of the lease, though.</p>", "<p>The Essential Phone and Galaxy S8 may share similar internals, but they are two very different devices. The former boasts a durable (albeit not waterproof) titanium design with great cameras, a novel accessory system, and close-to-stock Android software. The latter offers one of the best screens and cameras on the market, Samsung\u2019s TouchWiz software, and a bevy of accessories.

But if delayed shipments, privacy gaffes, and disappointing sales weren\u2019t bad enough, Essential\u2019s latest setback threatens to do lasting damage to its smartphone business. On Tuesday, October 17,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.keyssa.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Keyssa</a>, a wireless company backed by iPod creator and <a href=\"http://nest.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nest</a> founder Tony Fadell, filed a lawsuit against Essential alleging that it stole trade secrets.</p>", "<p>The dispute stems from Essential\u2019s work with Keyssa\u2019s transfer technology, which copies gigabit-size using a low-frequency network.\u00a0According to documents made public, Essential sought Keyssa\u2019s technical consultation under a non-disclosure agreement, working with a team of the firm\u2019s \u201ctop engineers and scientists\u201d and exchanging \u201cmany thousands\u201d of emails, technical documents, and confidential presentations.</p>", "<p>In August, Essential <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-keyssa-lawsuit/android-co-creators-startup-sued-over-connector-technology-idUSKBN1CL2OO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told Reuters</a> that it \u201cconsidered Keyssa as a component supplier for Essential Phone and chose to proceed with a different supplier that could meet our performance specifications for the product.\u201d</p>", "<p>Essential decided to end the relationship after 10 months, assuring Keyssa that it would use a different wireless technology in the Essential Phone (it eventually sourced it from <a href=\"http://sibeam.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sibeam</a>). But Keyssa says it reneged on the confidentiality agreement, knowingly implementing antenna designs and techniques in the phone\u2019s modular accessories pin.</p>", "<p>It\u2019s not Essential\u2019s first legal dispute. In June, accessory maker <a href=\"http://spigen.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spigen</a>, which has a trademark on the\u00a0Essential name for certain battery packs, chargers, and Bluetooth headphones, sent a\u00a0cease-and-desist letter to Essential, accusing it of misappropriation. It still hasn\u2019t been resolved \u2014 Essential\u2019s trademark application was denied twice because it sought the use \u201cEssential\u201d for a nonspecific range of consumer electronics products, according to <a href=\"http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/06/02/spigen-accuses-andy-rubins-company-essential-products-trademark-infringement-essential-responds-%F0%9F%96%95%E0%B2%A0_%E0%B2%A0%F0%9F%96%95/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Android Police</a>.</p>", "<p>But if Keyssa\u2019s lawsuit is found to have merit, the impact could be far worse. The Essential Phone\u2019s range of modular accessories, which attach to the back of the phone using a combination of magnetic pins and a 60GHz wireless USB adapter, is one of the handset\u2019s selling points. At launch, some models were bundled with the clip-on <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/essential-phone-review/\">Essential Camera</a>, an impressive 360-degree, 12-megapixel 4K camera that Essential claims is the \u201cworld\u2019s smallest.\u201d</p>", "<p>Keyssa, which earlier this year partnered with smartphone manufacturers like Samsung and Foxconn, says it is seeking damages. \u201cKeyssa has not been compensated for Essential\u2019s use of this guidance and know-how,\u201d a spokesperson told <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-keyssa-lawsuit/android-co-creators-startup-sued-over-connector-technology-idUSKBN1CL2OO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reuters</a>. \u201cWe are pursuing this action because our attempts to resolve this matter through discussions with Essential have not been successful.\u201d</p>", "<p>The court proceedings in San Francisco are scheduled to begin later in 2017.</p>"]},

It\u2019s an Android smartphone, unsurprisingly, but one with an edge-to-edge screen, innovative accessories, and high-end materials that set it apart\u00a0from the crowd. Read our <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/essential-phone-review/\">Essential Phone review</a> to hear our thoughts on the smartphone.</p>", "<p>The Essential Phone may not have set the world on fire, but it\u2019s still a great phone, especially at the same price as <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-cheap-smartphones/\">a budget handset</a>. The Amazon exclusive Halo Gray model of the Essential Phone was available for a limited on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078SQ7GWK/?th=1&amp;tag=dt-incontent-btn-20&amp;tag=dt-incontent-btn-20\">Amazon for just $224</a>, down from its usual price of $345,</p>", "<p>Equipped with the Snapdragon 835, 4GB of RAM, a 128GB hard drive, and made from ceramic, the Essential Phone is an absolute steal at this price. Since it\u2019s confirmed to be receiving <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/android-p-when-do-you-get-it/\">Android 9.0 Pie</a>, it\u2019s also one of the cheapest ways to experience the newest version of Android when it updates.</p>", "<p>In its <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/essential/comments/8zpffj/monthly_ama_with_essential_team_july_18_from/\">July 2018 AMA</a> on Reddit, Essential announced the phone will definitely receive the Android 9.0 Pie update, and will likely get the update to Android Q in 2019. When asked if an Android Q update would happen a spokesperson for the company replied \u201cI don\u2019t have any information about when Q would drop, and obviously that would have an effect on this answer. Assuming the schedule for Q is like the schedule for P we plan to do it.\u201d</p>", "<p>Essential is adding an Audio Adapter HD, which will be available in summer 2018 and basically delivers full MQA rendering coupled with what the company calls an \u201caudiophile-grade\u201d amp. It also adds a headphone jack \u2014 so if you miss that feature, you\u2019ll be able to get one back with the new adapter.</p>", "<p>Essential has announced that it will bring\u00a0three new updates to the Essential Phone to improve the audio experience. First of all, the device is now MQA-certified. What that means is that the device will support the MQA audio codec aimed at delivering the highest-quality audio possible.</p>", "<p>In March 2018 Essential released its Android 8.1 update with support for Project Treble. The first sales figures for the Essential Phone were revealed in a tweet by the <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/\">International Data Corporation\u2019s</a> (IDC) research director Francisco Jeronimo, and they were not good. The company project Essential shipped less than 90,000 handsets within its first six months.</p>", "<p>In its December 2017\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/essential/comments/7jf8rx/biweekly_ama_with_essential_team_dec_13_from/\">Reddit AMA</a>, Essential announced Project Treble would arrive with the Android 8.1 update.

The first available should be the charging dock,\u201d an Essential team member wrote. \u201cWe are also actively developing a high-end audio accessory to support a 3.5mm jack.\u201d</p>", "<p>A November 2017\u00a0<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.essential.klik&amp;hl=en\">update</a> for the Essential Phone brought portrait mode to the rear-facing camera, a feature available on the iPhone X, Pixel 2, and several other Android flagships. The update also offers stability updates and improves image quality by reducing JPEG compression. The latest update for the app (via <a href=\"http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/essential-phone-camera-update-play-store-download-3391223\">Trusted Reviews</a>) introduced much-needed auto-HDR, better dynamic HDR, and improved general performance and scene rendering.</p>", "<p>Essential\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.essential.com/blog/a-quick-camera-update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">released an update</a>\u00a0to its camera app in September 2017, with several improvements. You\u2019ll have to first install the latest system build (NMI81C) and then update the camera app through Google Play. The changes include boosted capture speed in regular and low light to below 1 second, countdown timer when in 360 camera mode, improved brightness and performance in low light, spatial sound when shooting in 360, the ability to use volume up and down keys as shutter buttons in 360 camera mode, and bug fixes.</p>", "<p>Shortly after the Essential Phone was launched, a Halo Gray version of the phone was announced as part of the Amazon Prime Exclusive Phones program. The Halo Gray handset ships with\u00a0Amazon\u2019s digital assistant, Alexa, installed right out of the box. According to Essential, you can uninstall Alexa if you so choose.

The 5.71-inch, QHD (2,560 x 1,312 pixels) screen \u2014 which Essential calls the Full Display \u2014 extends from the\u00a0bottom of the phone\u2019s thin bezel to the top. And unusually, the screen curves around the phone\u2019s selfie camera, obscuring part of the Android status bar.</p>", "<p>The PH-1 is compact and light, clocking in at a weight of less than 185 grams and a thickness of 7.8mm. It\u2019s durable, too, thanks to a combination of titanium, ceramic material, and Gorilla Glass 5. But those design choices necessitated compromise \u2014 just like the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-7-review/\">iPhone 7</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/htc-u11-review/\">HTC U11</a>, the PH-1 doesn\u2019t have a 3.5mm headphone socket.</p>", "<p>\u201cHeadphone jacks are pretty big components and they don\u2019t play nice with all-screen Phone architectures,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7048au/im_andy_rubin_cofounder_of_the_mobile_operating/dn0ajz1/\">said</a> an Essential engineer in a Reddit Q&amp;A. \u201cWe studied it very seriously, but fitting a headphone jack into our Phone required tradeoffs we were uncomfortable with. We\u2019d have grow a huge \u201cchin\u201d in the display and reduce the battery capacity by 10 percent, or we\u2019d need a huge headphone bump! We decided it was more important to have a beautiful full-screen display in a thin device with solid battery life. Then we made sure we to build ya\u2019ll [sic] a high-quality DAC in a tiny adapter that can elegantly live on your headphones. \u2013 Dave\u201d</p>", "<p>Under the PH-1\u2019s hood lies a Qualcomm\u00a0Snapdragon 835 processor, an Adreno 540 GPU, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of internal storage. The two camera lenses on the phone\u2019s rear, a 13-megapixel dual RGB color lens with hybrid autofocus (combining contrast, phase detect, and IR laser assist) and a second f/1.85 monochrome lens, can shoot videos at 4K 30fps (or 1080p 60fps/720p 120fps) and capture\u00a0200 percent more light than the\u00a0average sensor. And the 8-megapixel, f/2.2 selfie camera can record video at 4K resolution.</p>", "<p>The PH-1\u2019s other highlights include four microphones in a three-dimensional arrangement that filters out background noise, a 3,040mAh battery with rapid charging technology, a barometer, a USB Type-C port, and a rear fingerprint sensor that Essential claims is the \u201cfastest available technology.\u201d</p>", "<p>You\u2019ll find a 3,040mAh battery in the Essential Phone which should be enough to power the phone through a day of heavy use. And luckily the phone supports fast-charging so it replenishes the battery quickly.</p>", "<p>The Essential Phone ships with Android 7.1.1 Nougat, but can be updated to Android 8.1 Oreo. \u00a0We expect to see an Android P update for the Essential Phone shortly after its launched, and the company said it\u2019s likely the phone will also receive an Android Q update in 2019.</p>", "<p>When it comes to special features, Essential phone is joined by a <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/moto-mods-mwc-2017/\">Moto Mod-style</a> range of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/30/15711194/essential-phone-modular-magnetic-accessory-system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">modular accessories</a>, which attach using a combination of magnetic pins and a 60GHz wireless USB adapter on the device\u2019s back. A couple of modules (which Essential calls \u201cClick Connectors\u201d) have been announced so far: A 360-degree camera, and a dock that charges the phone when it\u2019s not in use.</p>", "<p>The Essential Phone features a dual camera module with a 13-megapixel lenses. Both lenses have an f/1.85 aperture. The primary lens on the Essential Phone shoots in color while the secondary lens shoots in black and white. You\u2019ll find an 8-megapixel shooter on the front of the phone.</p>", "<p>When the Essential Phone was first released, many were underwhelmed with its camera. However, Essential has released a number of camera updates over the past year that vastly improve its performance.</p>", "<p>In addition to the built-in camera modules on the Essential Phone, there\u2019s also the Essential Camera, which the company claims is the \u201cworld\u2019s smallest\u201d 360-degree camera. It attaches to magnets at the top of the phone\u2019s body, allowing it to poke its \u201chead\u201d over the top of the phone. The camera comes in at just 35 grams, and has two 12-megapixel lenses that can shoot 4K resolution, 30 fps video, as well as four microphones that capture sound in 3D. Following a tease that\u00a0<a href=\"https://support.essential.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007853827-Can-the-360-camera-stream-live-video-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">support for livestreaming</a> would soon also be included, the Essential Camera has now made good on its promise.</p>", "<p>After a rocky start, the Essential Phone began shipping on August 25, 2017. And while some early buyers paid $700 for the handset, Essential quickly lowered the price to $500 and temporarily offered a $200 credit for the Essential Store for those early purchasers.</p>", "<p>All four major U.S. carriers support the Essential Phone. Sprint is the only carrier that carries the phone and accessories in-store.</p>", "<p>For those who don\u2019t live in the United States, the Essential Phone is available on the <a href=\"https://www.essential.com\">company\u2019s website</a> for customers in Canada, France, Japan, and the United Kingdom.</p>", "<p>Essential is also planning to release a smart speaker with an intelligent assistant \u2014 the <a href=\"https://www.essential.com/home\">Essential Home</a>. It\u2019s similar to Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google Home, the main difference being a\u00a0circular screen that shows exactly what tasks the Essential Home is performing.</p>", "<p>Essential Home\u2019s round \u201cauto-display\u201d can be activated with a tap, a glance, or a question. Just like Amazon\u2019s Echo speakers, Microsoft\u2019s Cortana Assistant, and Google Home, it lets you control music, set timers, and more. There\u2019s no word on a release date at this time, but it has been promised that it\u00a0will work with smart home platforms like SmartThings, HomeKit, and Nest.</p>", "<p>Essential Home runs a new operating system called\u00a0Ambient OS, which Essential describes as a \u201cproactive life manager.\u201d It will notify you when you need to leave early to make an important meeting, or if you appear to have forgotten about an upcoming appointment. And it will secure your data by storing it locally, on your in-home network, rather than on a remote server like Google Home and Amazon\u2019s Alexa.</p>", "<p><i>Updated on August 20: The Essential Phone is available for $224 on Amazon, for a limited time.<br>\n</i></p>"]},

It will reportedly have a small screen, and the user will mostly interact with it through voice controls, which will work with Essential\u2019s own artificial intelligence software. In other words, the device will aim to be more of a digital assistant than any phone before it.</p>", "<p>It all sounds a bit sci-fi, but that\u2019s apparently the point. Andy Rubin, co-founder of Android and founder of Essential Products, is reportedly trying to build a device that \u201ccaptures people\u2019s imagination\u201d by being something that\u2019s totally different from the competition.</p>", "<p>Of course, Essential has a long road ahead of it. Currently, the consumer A.I. space is dominated by the likes of Google, Amazon, and Apple, but even the assistants from those companies sometimes fail, forcing the user to manually perform the task they\u2019re asking the assistant to do. With a phone that has only a small display, manually doing tasks may be much harder. The new device, however, could be targeted at those who want to spend less time using their phones.</p>", "<p>So when will we see Essential\u2019s new device? Essential reportedly aims to have the first prototype ready by the end of the year, but it\u2019s unlikely consumers will see what that prototype looks like. According to the Bloomberg report, Essential is aiming to show the device off to industry partners at the Consumer Electronics Show in January in Las Vegas \u2014 though consumers probably won\u2019t see the device until well into 2019.</p>", "<p>Even when Essential does eventually release the new device, there\u2019s no guarantee that it will sell \u2014 and if it doesn\u2019t, this could be one of the last devices we see from Essential.</p>"]},

The plan was to create modular components for its flagship phone every quarter, and then launch a smart home product called Essential Home, running a proprietary operating system called Ambient OS. To date, the company has only launched one module \u2014 a 360-degree camera \u2014 and a few different color variants of the original Essential Phone. The device\u2019s price also dropped fairly quickly from $700 to below $500.</p>", "<p>Now, the Bloomberg report states the company is considering selling its patent portfolio, the original Essential Phone as well as the 360-degree camera, its engineers, and its smart home product. Oh, and it has ceased development of an upcoming phone, presumably the Essential Phone (PH-2). A final decision hasn\u2019t been made yet.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe always have multiple products in development at the same time and we embrace canceling some in favor of the ones we think will be bigger hits,\u2019 an Essential spokesperson told Digital Trends. \u201cWe are putting all of our efforts toward our future, game-changing products, which include mobile and home products.\u201d</p>", "<p>Rubin also tweeted out the same exact response.</p>", "<p>It sounds as though development of the Essential Phone 2 has been canceled. Only 150,000 Essential Phones have been sold to date, which is why the company may be gearing up to exit the smartphone business. Bloomberg states there is a chance it could re-enter the market, as Essential has explored using a different manufacturer other than Foxconn.</p>", "<p>The Essential Home is reportedly still in the works and it\u2019s expected to launch next year, according to Bloomberg\u2019s sources.</p>"]},

The Essential Phone was priced at $700 upon launch, entering a field populated by Apple\u2019s iPhone X, Google\u2019s Pixel 2 XL, and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 8. The price tag was later reduced to $500, which made the Essential Phone more appealing to customers.</p>", "<p>The Essential Phone went out of stock over the holiday season, partly due to significant price cuts that indicated retailers were <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/28/essential-phone-wont-be-restocked-discontinued/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cleaning out</a> the device\u2019s inventory. It appears that this marks the end of the device, so, unfortunately, customers who were planning to buy the Essential PH-1 after the holidays will likely find it very hard to do so.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe are sold out of Essential Phone on essential.com and won\u2019t be adding any new inventory. We are now hard at work on our next mobile product and will continue to sell accessories and provide speedy software updates and customer support to our existing community,\u201d <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2018/12/28/essential-phone-rip-stock-discontinued/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> a spokesman for the company.</p>", "<p>Current Essential Phone users will be happy to know that despite the phone\u2019s discontinuation, Essential reiterated that updates for it will continue. Essential previously promised that the Essential PH-1 will be upgraded at least to <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/possible-android-q-names/\">Android Q</a>.</p>", "<p>Another positive note from the spokesman\u2019s statement is the confirmation that Essential is working on its next product. It was previously reported that the device will be an artificial intelligence-powered <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/essential-phone-2-news/\">smartphone </a>that performs tasks by mimicking its user, such as automatically replying to messages.</p>", "<p>The new smartphone is said to have a unique design, with a small screen because users will interact with it mostly through voice commands. It will certainly be a different device compared to the competition, and there are rumors that Essential will be ready to show off the smartphone at CES 2019 in January.</p>", "<p>Essential is able to roll out major Android updates for the Essential Phone faster than other non-Google Android smartphone manufacturers, and it is expected that the company will do the same for the rumored new smartphone.</p>"]},

And while various freeze-first varieties have popped up over the years, they all have two serious drawbacks: first, they last about as long as one beer. Second, they leave a puppy-sized puddle on the table as they melt. The revolutionary Tjiller, aside from being delightfully difficult to pronounce, has been designed with a proprietary gel that sits behind an aluminum membrane. This is the point of contact with the can, which ensures a slow release of temperature that keeps the Tjiller cold and dry long after your Kisai Intoxicated watch tells you it\u2019s time to go home.</p>", "<p><a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DT-2013-Summer-tech-guide-Fujifilm-FinePix-XP200.jpg\" data-dt-zoomable=\"1\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-dt-lazy-src=\"http://img.digitaltrends.com/image/dt-2013-summer-tech-guide-fujifilm-finepix-xp200-300x300.jpg\" onerror=\"dti_load_error(this)\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-456710 dt-lazy-load dt-lazy-pending\" alt=\"DT 2013 Summer tech guide Fujifilm FinePix XP200\"></a>There are various ways to tell if your summer vacation won\u2019t suck.

The <a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/digital-camera-reviews/fujifilm-finepix-xp200-review/\">FinePix XP200</a> has a 16-megapixel CMOS sensor for better low-light capture, image stabilization, a 5x optical zoom, and shoots video in 1080i HD; but that\u2019s not why you need it this summer. You need it because all of the above come packaged in a bomb-proof casing that\u2019s waterproof to 50 feet and shockproof to 6.6 feet.

(Hey, just because you\u2019re hardcore doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t wanna kick it next to the campfire and play Plants vs. Zombies, right?) The Biolite uses heat to create thermoelectric power and charge it\u2019s built-in battery. Like any campstove worth its salt, it also has a fan to get your biomass fuel up to temperatures high enough to boil a cup of water in about two minutes \u2013 just enough time to text your friends and tell them how much better meals taste when taken under a canopy of stars, far from their petty luxuries.\u00a0</p>", "<p><a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DT-2013-Summer-tech-guide-Kisai-Intoxicated-LCD-Watch.jpg\" data-dt-zoomable=\"1\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-dt-lazy-src=\"http://img.digitaltrends.com/image/dt-2013-summer-tech-guide-kisai-intoxicated-lcd-watch-300x300.jpg\" onerror=\"dti_load_error(this)\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-456713 dt-lazy-load dt-lazy-pending\" alt=\"DT 2013 Summer tech guide Kisai Intoxicated LCD Watch\"></a>The only downside to summer BBQs is the part where you drive home tipsy, get pulled over, and lose your license \u2026 or worse.

Just blow into the watch, and its blood-alcohol meter tells you exactly how much sauce is flowing through your veins. The LCD screen lights up green, yellow, or red to quickly let you know when Johnny Law is going to strongly disapprove of your driving. Of course, Intoxicated also sports a clock, calendar, alarm, and charges via USB \u2013 none of which will be of much use if you wind up in jail, but are otherwise useful little additions to a device that will make you the most responsible killjoy at the party.\u00a0</p>", "<p><a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/samsung-ativ-5.jpg\" data-dt-zoomable=\"1\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-dt-lazy-src=\"http://img.digitaltrends.com/image/samsung-ativ-5-300x300.jpg\" onerror=\"dti_load_error(this)\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-456729 dt-lazy-load dt-lazy-pending\" alt=\"DT 2013 Summer tech guide samsung ativ book 5\"></a>It\u2019s summer; no matter how much work you have to do, you are\u00a0<i>not</i>\u00a0doing it at the office.
