            "<p>Huawei has finally unveiled the all-new Huawei Mate 20 series, including the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/huawei-mate-20-pro-review/\">flagship Mate 20 Pro</a>. The new device boasts top-tier specs, an excellent design, and a number of exciting new technologies \u2014 including an in-display fingerprint sensor.</p>",
            "<p>But the Huawei Mate 20 Pro has big shoes to fill. Last year\u2019s Mate 10 Pro was also much-loved, boasting excellent specs and a great design. Can the new Mate in town take out the older Mate 10 Pro? We put the two phones head-to-head to find out.</p>",
            "<p>As you might expect, the Huawei Mate 20 Pro is clearly a better performer than the older Huawei Mate 10 Pro \u2014 thanks largely to an upgraded processor. While the Mate 10 Pro features Huawei\u2019s own Kirin 970 processor, the Mate 20 Pro steps things up with a <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/huawei-kirin-980-news/\">newer-generation Kirin 980</a>, which is around 20 percent faster and 40 percent more power efficient than the older chip. That\u2019s not to say that the Kirin 970 isn\u2019t a great chipset \u2014 it is \u2014 but the Kirin 980 is clearly a better performer. In the Mate 10 Pro, the processor is coupled with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM, along with either 64GB or 128GB of storage, while the Mate 20 Pro sticks with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.</p>",
            "<p>The battery inside the Mate 10 Pro was already a great performer, coming in at 4,000mAh \u2014 but the Mate 20 Pro takes it up a notch to 4,200mAh. Now, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the phone will last longer on a charge, especially considering the larger, higher-resolution display. Still, it does bode well for a long battery life. Batteries can be charged a few different ways depending on the phone. On the Mate 20 Pro, you\u2019ll enjoy wireless charging support, as well as Huawei\u2019s own \u201cSuper Charge 2.0,\u201d which is a 40W charging system that should charge the phone to 70 percent in just 30 minutes. The Mate 10 Pro doesn\u2019t have wireless charging, and offers the original Huawei Super Charge, which will charge to around 55 percent in 30 minutes.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Huawei Mate 20 Pro</strong></p>",
            "<p>The Huawei Mate 20 Pro features a modern design thanks to its edge-to-edge display and all-glass build. It does have a notch, which may not please all Android fans, but it\u2019s not an overly deep or pronounced notch \u2014 like the one on the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-xl-review/\">Google Pixel 3 XL</a> \u2014 meaning that it\u2019ll be easy to forget about. The display on the device comes in at 6.4 inches.</p>",
            "<p>The Mate 10 Pro may not look quite as modern as the newer phone, but it\u2019s still not a bad-looking device. There\u2019s a small forehead and chin on the phone, but they\u2019re easy to ignore.</p>",
            "<p>When it comes to durability, the phones are very similar. Both phones feature a glass build, despite the Mate 10 Pro not offering wireless charging. The main difference, of course, is the water resistance \u2014 the Mate 10 Pro has a rating of IP67, while the Mate 20 Pro steps things up to IP68.</p>",
            "<p>The Mate 20 Pro features a more modern design and is slightly more durable. It\u2019s the clear winner.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Huawei Mate 20 Pro</strong></p>",
            "<p>When it comes to display, it\u2019s another easy win for the newer phone. Both the Huawei Mate 10 Pro and the Mate 20 Pro feature AMOLED displays. However, while the display on the Mate 10 Pro comes in at 6 inches with a resolution of\u00a02,160 x 1,080 pixels for a pixel density of 402 pixels-per-inch, the Mate 20 Pro is a serious upgrade with s 6.4-inch display,\u00a03,120 x 1,440 resolution, and 538 pixels-per-inch pixel density. That makes the Mate 20 Pro\u2019s display one of the best on the market.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Huawei Mate 20 Pro</strong></p>",
            "<p>The Huawei Mate 10 Pro had one of the best smartphone cameras available at its time of release, boasting a dual-sensor setup with one 12-megapixel sensor and one 20-megapixel monochrome sensor, both with an aperture of f/1.6. Other features include optical image stabilization, laser autofocus, and more. We found that in the real world, the camera was pretty spectacular too \u2014 photos were crisp and detailed, while colors were nice and vibrant.</p>",
            "<p>The Mate 20 Pro, of course, aims to improve on this. The new device features three sensors instead of two, including one 40-megapixel main sensor with an f/1.8 aperture, one 20-megapixel wide-angle sensor with an aperture of f/2.2, and one 8-megapixel telephoto lens with an aperture of f/2.4. On the front, you\u2019ll find a 24-megapixel sensor. The Mate 20 Pro\u2019s camera performs extremely well, and it\u2019s definitely more versatile than the camera in its predecessor.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Huawei Mate 20 Pro</strong></p>",
            "<p>Both the Mate 10 Pro and Mate 20 Pro are Android phones, and they feature Huawei\u2019s Android skin, EMUI. The Mate 10 Pro ships with Android 8.0 Oreo, though an update to Android 9.0 Pie has started rolling out. The Mate 20 Pro, on the other hand, ships with <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/android-9-pie-review/\">Android 9.0 Pie</a> \u2014 so it\u2019s relatively up to date.</p>",
            "<p>Huawei isn\u2019t known for for updating phones quickly, which may be frustrating for those who like to get new Android features as soon as they become available. If that\u2019s you, then perhaps you\u2019re better off with a <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-review/\">Pixel phone</a>.</p>",
            "<p>EMUI may also not be for everyone. Icons are a little different, and there are a range of tweaks to <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/huawei-emui-9-interview/\">how the software works</a>, which might be a little confusing for a first-time Huawei user.</p>",
            "<p>The software experience on these phones is going to be very similar, but given the fact that the Huawei Mate 20 Pro is newer, and therefore expected to be supported with updates for longer, it\u2019s the winner here.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Huawei Mate 20 Pro</strong></p>",
            "<p>Both the Huawei Mate 10 Pro and the Huawei Mate 20 Pro feature Huawei\u2019s own Neural Processing Unit, or NPU \u2014 however the one in the Mate 20 Pro is likely to be faster and more powerful. On top of that, the Mate 20 Pro offers features like a new Face ID-like facial-recognition system and an in-display fingerprint sensor, helping it win this category.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Huawei Mate 20 Pro</strong></p>",
            "<p>The Huawei Mate 10 Pro has been out for a year now and has been discounted a few times. Right now, you can get one on Amazon for $500. The Mate 20 Pro, on the other hand, is brand-new \u2014 so expect flagship phone pricing. The device isn\u2019t actually coming to the U.S., but in Europe it\u2019ll be available starting at 1,049 euros, which equates to around $1,220.</p>",
            "<p>No surprises here \u2014 the Huawei Mate 20 Pro is clearly the better phone. It offers better performance, better design, a better display, and a better camera too. That\u2019s not to say that the Mate 10 Pro isn\u2019t a great device \u2014 in fact, of these two phones, it might be the only option available to you, due to the fact that the Mate 20 Pro isn\u2019t coming to the U.S. The older phone is also potentially less than half the price. But if you do have a choice between the two and don\u2019t mind spending the extra cash, we definitely recommend buying the Mate 20 Pro.</p>"

            "<p>Huawei is on a roll.\u00a0The Chinese company produced the hit\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/huawei-p20-pro-review/\">Huawei P20 Pro</a>\u00a0smartphone at the start of 2018, which earned praised for its excellent camera and beautiful design. But Huawei\u2019s not done yet, and it ended the year by revealing the Huawei Mate 20 range. The Mate 20, Mate 20 Pro, and Mate 20 X follow the impressive <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/huawei-mate-20-lite-review/\">Mate 20 Lite</a> and introduce Huawei\u2019s latest hardware and beautiful design.</p>",
            "<p>Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/huawei-mate-20-review/\">Huawei Mate 20</a>, <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/huawei-mate-20-pro-review/\">Mate 20 Pro</a>, and the supersized Mate 20 X.</p>",
            "<p>The west may have celebrated New Year already, but it\u2019s not due in China until February \u2014 and there <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_plan_launch_red_mate_20_pro-news-34880.php\">might be</a> <a href=\"https://www.droidshout.com/huawei-mate-20-pro/\">two new editions</a> of the Huawei Mate 20 Pro to celebrate it. According to <a href=\"https://news.mydrivers.com/1/609/609677.htm\">MyDrivers</a>, a special Fragrant Red and Comet Blue Mate 20 Pro have been spotted on Chinese microblogging site Weibo. An image has been leaked of the Fragrant Red option, but the only apparent evidence of the Comet Blue variant is apparently from source code. Still, Chinese companies love to celebrate Chinese New Year, so it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see at least one of these new colors launched in China come February.</p>",
            "<p>The Huawei Mate 20 is clearly one of the best Android phones of the year \u2014 but unfortunately it\u2019ll be very hard to get the device for yourself if you live in the U.S. The news comes from a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/huawei-mate-20-mate-20-pro-unavailable-us-spying-fears-2018-10?op=1\" rel=\"noopener\">report from Business Insider</a>\u00a0in which a Huawei spokesperson confirmed that the company won\u2019t be selling the device in the U.S. If you\u00a0<em>really</em> want the phone, it\u2019s possible you might be able to find it through some online retailers \u2014 but given the fact that the U.S. sometimes uses different network frequencies and technologies, you\u2019ll want to carefully check on network compatibility before you buy.</p>",
            "<p>Huawei\u2019s designs have always been in line with the latest mobile trends, and the Mate 20, Mate 20 Pro, and Mate 20 X are no different. You\u2019ll find glass with gently curving sides laid over solid aluminum frames, and notches cut into both displays \u2014 but there are some fairly significant differences between Huawei\u2019s latest flagships and 2018\u2019s biggest trends.</p>",
            "<p>The most obvious change from the norm is the placement of the camera lenses on the back of the phone. While the use of three lenses is becoming more commonplace, having been introduced in Huawei\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/huawei-p20-pro-camera-tips/\">P20 Pro</a>, and continued in the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/lg-v40-thinq-review/\">LG V40 ThinQ,</a> it\u2019s the positioning of the lenses that is now more interesting than the number. Rather than a horizontal or vertical line, the Huawei Mate 20 series\u2019 three lenses are formed into a 2-by-2 box along with the camera\u2019s flash unit as the fourth member, forming a distinctive square. In a world where flagship phones are looking startlingly similar, this simple change makes the Mate 20 range stand out from the crowd.</p>",
            "<p>The glass on both phones has also seen some changes. While both phones still sport Huawei\u2019s magical color-changing glass backs, a \u201cfeatherline\u201d pattern has been added to both phones. This pattern helps to decrease the visual impact of greasy fingerprints on the back of the phones \u2014 hopefully ending this common scourge of glass phones. Huawei has also added an extra layer to the back as well, something referred to as \u201cvinyl tactility.\u201d This layer increases grip\u00a0significantly on the back of the phone, while still permitting the phone to retain the premium feel of pure glass.</p>",
            "<p>Flip the two phones over and you\u2019ll find some differences to set them apart from one another. The Mate 20 is equipped with a tiny Dewdrop notch cut into a 6.53-inch RGBW HDR display, running a 2244 x 1080 resolution in an 18.7:9 aspect ratio. The Mate 20 Pro is a slightly smaller phone, but rocks an impressive 6.39-inch curved OLED display, running a 3,120 x 1,440 resolution in a 19.5:9 aspect ratio. The Pro model also sports a notch, but it\u2019s cut much wider to accommodate an advanced 3D depth-sensing array built into the front of the phone. The Mate 20 X is the largest of the three phones by a significant margin. It\u2019s equipped with a huge 7.2-inch HDR display, and emulates the look of the Mate 20, complete with Dewdrop notch.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll find a fingerprint sensor on the back of the Mate 20 \u2014 but it\u2019s missing on the Mate 20 Pro. Instead, Huawei has incorporated fingerprint scanning tech into that phone\u2019s OLED display. This is definitely the mobile world\u2019s next major advance, and it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve seen Huawei put it into one of its mainstream phones. Huawei first tested out the tech in the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/porsche-design-huawei-mate-rs-review/\">Porsche Design Huawei Mate RS</a>, and it\u2019s been revamped since that first buggy release.</p>",
            "<p>Only the Mate 20 Pro should be able to survive a slip into the pool, with IP68-rated water-resistance. The Mate 20 is only rated at IP54, and the Mate 20 X is rated for IP53, and can only withstand splashes. As a modern flagship phone, the Mate 20 Pro lacks a headphone jack, while the venerable port is still present on the less advanced Mate 20 and Mate 20 X.</p>",
            "<p>The Mate 20 series phones will be available in five colors from release \u2014 Black, Twilight, Midnight Blue, Emerald Green, and Pink Gold.</p>",
            "<p>While Huawei eschews the year\u2019s usual Snapdragon 845 processor for its flagship phones, its own proprietary Kirin processors have usually kept up with the curve, providing great performance.</p>",
            "<p>The Mate 20 series presents the first Huawei phones to feature the new Kirin 980, the next advance of Huawei\u2019s processor tech. It\u2019s an eight-core processor, and Huawei\u2019s first built on the 7-nanometer process \u2014 basically, it\u2019s super-small. The 980 consists of four little cores that handle low-intensity tasks, two middle cores for more demanding tasks, and two advanced cores that will blast through the most demanding of apps and games. Huawei claims this new processor boosts speed by 20 percent and power efficiency by 40 percent when compared to the older Kirin 970.</p>",
            "<p>But it\u2019s not just about raw power. Huawei is continuing its drive toward\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/huawei-ai-kirin-970-npu/\">an A.I.-powered future</a>, and has included two neural processing units (NPUs) inside the heart of the Kirin 980. The Kirin 970 also boasted a single one of these cores, but Huawei claims that these two newer NPUs outstrip the older NPU by 134 percent in performance, and 88 percent in power efficiency. Thanks to this massively boosted capacity, the Mate 20 range will do an awful lot more in the NPU, with support for real-time image processing, and object recognition and segmentation \u2014 not only in photos, but also in video.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll get the choice between 4GB of RAM and 6GB on the Mate 20, while the Mate 20 Pro and Mate 20 X will ship with 6GB as standard. Regardless of which model you pick, you\u2019ll be getting 128GB of onboard storage \u2014 with the option of boosting that by up to 256GB via expandable storage. However, it\u2019s not like regular MicroSD expansion \u2014 Huawei is pushing a new proprietary nano memory card for some reason, so your trusty old MicroSD won\u2019t work.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll find huge batteries backing up these powerful phones. The Mate 20 comes with a 4,000mAh battery, while the Mate 20 Pro goes one better with a 4,200mAh battery. We\u2019ve seen incredible two-day battery life from past Huawei flagships, and we\u2019re expecting similar performance from both of these.</p>",
            "<p>The Mate 20 X takes it even further, with a massive 5,000mAh battery to power the huge 7.2-inch display. The Mate 20 X also comes with an innovative new cooling system that uses a combination of graphene film and a vapor chamber to funnel heat away from the battery and CPU \u2014 which means the Mate 20 X should be able to keep on ticking without dropping performance or damaging the phone\u2019s internals.</p>",
            "<p>Huawei\u2019s SuperCharge fast charging is back, too, and Huawei claims the 40W charger included with the Mate 20 Pro will charge up to 70 percent battery in just 30 minutes. The Mate 20 and Mate 20 X come with a lower powered 22.5W charger, but we\u2019re still expecting incredibly fast charging. For comparison, the iPhone XS ships <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-fast-charge-your-iphone/\">with a 5W charger</a>, giving you an idea of how powerful these chargers are.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll get 15W fast wireless charging support for both phones, which Huawei claims is 200 percent faster than wireless charging on an iPhone X. There\u2019s even more impressive tech included in the Mate 20 Pro though \u2014 it will be able to wirelessly charge other wireless charging devices. This feature has been rumored to work with an upcoming pair of Huawei wireless earphones \u2014 the Freebuds 2 Pro.</p>",
            "<p>Like all of Huawei\u2019s phones, the Mate 20 range comes with Huawei\u2019s customized Android skin \u2014 Emotion UI (<a href=\"https://consumer.huawei.com/en/emui/\">EMUI</a>). It\u2019s certainly not the phone for Android purists, as EMUI is one of the more overtly different Android skins, and some may balk at the iOS-like style added. Still, it has improved greatly over the years, and it\u2019s an operating system we\u2019ve grown to enjoy using.</p>",
            "<p>Surprisingly the Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro will launch with <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-android-p-news/\">Android 9.0 Pie</a>\u2018s version of EMUI already installed. Customized Android skins like EMUI usually come sometime after a major Android release, and it\u2019s surprising that Huawei has managed to launch EMUI 9 so fast when <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/android-p-when-do-you-get-it/\">other manufacturers are lagging behind</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Like Android 9 Pie, EMUI 9 has seen some major changes and tune-ups. Settings have been hidden away to reduce the complexity of the system, and more intuitive touch settings have been added to make controlling the phone much easier than before. It\u2019s faster, too \u2014 Huawei says starting an app has been sped up by up to 51 percent, while smoothness inside apps has been boosted by 42 percent. Huawei\u2019s throwing shade, too, claiming that the Mate 20 range is 400 ms faster on average than the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review/\">Galaxy Note 9</a> at starting an app.</p>",
            "<p>Huawei\u2019s also worked hard to reduce the level at which the Mate 20 range will slow down over time. Entropy is a fact of life, but the struggle against it is what defines life \u2014 and by that barometer, Huawei has done a terrific job in reducing the rate at which a phone slows as it ages. While it\u2019s impossible to prove in practice until the phones have been out for some time, Huawei\u2019s simulations say that the Mate 20 should only slow down 5 percent after 18 months. By comparison, Huawei\u2019s simulations claim the Note 9 will slow by 28 percent in the same period.</p>",
            "<p>Huawei\u2019s desktop mode will also be making a comeback in the Mate 20 range, so you\u2019ll be able to plug your phone into a display to get a PC-like experience. An improved <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/huawei-honor-gpu-turbo-news/\">GPU Turbo</a> 2.0 mode is also included, which should boost gaming performance even further, and Huawei boasts of 22 percent higher stability and 14 percent more power efficiency compared to the same games on the Galaxy Note 9. A lot of <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-and-worst-features-android-9-pie/\">Android 9.0 Pie\u2019s biggest features</a> will also be available, including Digital Wellbeing and Wind-Down mode.</p>",
            "<p>The Huawei P20 Pro is one of the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-camera-phones/\">best camera phones</a>, and we\u2019re expecting that the Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro will strongly follow Huawei\u2019s reputation for high-quality photography.</p>",
            "<p>As mentioned earlier, you\u2019ll find three Leica lenses on the back of the Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro \u2014 a wide-angle lens, an ultra wide-angle lens, and a telephoto lens. However, you\u2019ll find different tech depending on which phone you pick up.</p>",
            "<p>The Mate 20\u2019s triple-camera system is comprised of a 16-megapixel ultra wide-angle lens with an f/2.2 aperture, a 12-megapixel wide-angle lens with an f/1.8 aperture, and an 8-megapixel 2-times telephoto zoom lens with optical image stabilization (OIS), and an f/2.4 aperture. The Pro model sports some bigger numbers, with a 40-megapixel wide-angle lens with an f/1.8 aperture, a 20-megapixel ultra wide-angle lens with an f/2.2 aperture, and an 8-megapixel 3-times telephoto zoom lens with OIS and an f/2.2 aperture.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s a similar set-up to the one we saw in the P20 Pro, with the exception that the pure monochrome lens has been dropped in favor of an ultra wide-angle lens. According to Huawei, the monochrome data was being used less than it expected, so the dedicated lens was dropped. But don\u2019t worry, monochrome is still available as a software feature. The new ultra wide-angle lens offers a great focal length for macro shots as well as with wider viewing angles, so it\u2019s likely Huawei\u2019s made a strong change here.</p>",
            "<p>A.I. is central to the performance of the Mate 20 range\u2019s camera, and Huawei has pushed the boundaries even further. Named the \u201cThinking Lens\u201d, A.I. will be able to control even more aspects of your camera, making it even easier for you to get great shots. While you can still manually swap between lenses, the A.I. will be able to automatically swap to the ultra wide-angle lens when it thinks it\u2019s needed. A.I. will also be able to recognize the primary object in a camera to keep it in focus, and will be able to apply cinematic effects with A.I. \u2014 like a Sin City-esque effect that keeps people in color, but shifts the surroundings to black and white.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll find the same 24-megapixel selfie lens in the front of each phone, but the Mate 20 Pro also comes with a much-improved face unlocking feature that uses 3D depth-sensing tech like the iPhone XS. The larger notch on the Mate 20 Pro houses a huge amount of new tech to enable this, including an infrared camera, dot projector, and time-of-flight proximity sensors. The already snappy unlocking speed has also been increased, and it will also recognize you if you\u2019re wearing a hat, or have spontaneously grown a beard. You\u2019ll also be able to use your face to access your new Huawei Password Vault, which stores passwords for your apps similar to Google\u2019s Autofill.</p>",
            "<p>Huawei is also continuing its partnership with Porsche, and is launching a super-premium version of the Mate 20 Pro with Porsche\u2019s branding.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll still find the same Kirin 980 processor inside the special Porsche branded Mate 20 Pro, but you\u2019ll also find 8GB of RAM, and you\u2019ll also get the choice between models with 256GB and 512GB of onboard storage. The in-display fingerprint sensor from the Mate 20 Pro is included, and so is the advanced 3D sensing face recognition. The Mate 20 Pro\u2019s triple-lens camera is there, too, but the battery has seen a decrease to a smaller 2,940mAh capacity.</p>",
            "<p>There\u2019s a bigger difference on the outside of this device though. The all-glass design of the Mate 20 Pro is out \u2014 instead, the Porsche Design Huawei Mate 20 RS has a central racing stripe of glass, flanked by soft and luxurious artisan leather. This leather adds grip to the device, and a super-premium feel. It\u2019s an utterly gorgeous device \u2014 but it has a price tag to match. The 8GB/256GB model starts at an eye-watering 1,695 euros (around $1,970), and rises to 2,095 euros (roughly $2,430) for the 8GB/512GB model.</p>",

The Mate 20 will start from 799 euros (roughly $930), while the Mate 20 Pro is more expensive, coming in at 1,049 euros (roughly $1,220). The supersized Mate 20 X will set you back 899 euros (roughly $1,050).</p>",

            "<p>The replacement to Huawei\u2019s successful P20 and P20 Pro will likely come during the first few months of 2018, and rumors about the device\u2019s new features are starting to leak. <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/huawei-p20-pro-review/\">The P20 Pro</a> was a trendsetter when it launched in March 2018, introducing the world to a high-performance triple-lens camera system with a night mode, plus the now more widespread gradient color scheme. What will the sequel bring? Here\u2019s what we know so far.</p>",
            "<p>The standout feature on the P-Series has always been the camera, and the P20 Pro set the bar for others to beat in 2018. The P30 is highly likely to add another camera lens to the setup, taking it from three to four, according to Huawei Europe boss Walter Ji, who said <a href=\"https://www.androidpit.de/quad-kamera-5g-flagship-stores-huaweis-plaene-fuer-2019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in an interview</a>, \u201cNext year we will definitely see more innovation in the camera. Now we have three, imagine four next year.\u201d He also commented on a greater zoom capability, potentially up to 10x. However, that fourth lens may not be used for photography. Instead, the fourth sensor <a href=\"https://www.slashgear.com/huawei-p30-leak-hints-at-an-oxymoronic-design-25559144/\">may be a Time-of-Flight sensor</a> (ToF) usually used for AR/VR mapping. Take this with a pinch of salt at the moment though, and wait to see what the other serial leakers find out in the coming months.</p>",
            "<p>Huawei has been linked to Sony for the P30, and according to this rumor may use the <a href=\"https://www.gizmochina.com/2018/12/12/38mp-sony-imx607-sensor-details-leaked-boasts-exceptional-low-light-performance-and-may-appear-first-in-the-huawei-p30-pro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">forthcoming IMX607 sensor</a>, which may add a 38-megapixel sensor to the phone. Huawei\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/huawei-nova-4-news/\">Nova 4</a> and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/honor-view-20-news/\">Honor\u2019s View 20</a> both have 48-megapixel sensors.</p>",
            "<p>What will the P30 or P30 Pro look like? A series of cases for the P30 Pro model have been spotted for sale through online retailer <a href=\"https://www.mobilefun.com/huawei/p30-pro/cases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MobileFun</a> which may give us a hint. The rear of the phone may once again have a series of camera lenses running down the left side, but this time there may be four rather than three.</p>",
            "<p>There is no sign of a fingerprint sensor on the front or back of the phone, indicating the in-screen fingerprint sensor from the Mate 20 Pro will come to the P30 Pro. The screen has a teardrop-style notch at the top, much like the Mate 20. This is surprising, as the Pro versions of Huawei phones often have more complex face recognition systems requiring a larger notch. It\u2019s possible this is speculation on the part of case maker Olixar, which may only have dimensions for the phone\u2019s body rather than final renders of the full design.</p>",
            "<p>Olixar\u2019s case is not the only one that has been spotted. A case for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1072718083989487616\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">non-Pro P30 was leaked</a> with a slightly different design, showing an elongated camera cutout on the left, and a further section underneath. It\u2019s not clear why this is separate. The <a href=\"https://www.mobilefun.com/huawei/p30/cases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Olixar P30 case</a> seems to combine the second cutout into one single larger cutout. The P30 Pro case in the Twitter leak from Ice Universe closely matches the Olixar case\u2019s look.</p>",
            "<p>No specific details have leaked about the Huawei P30 or P30 Pro\u2019s other features. However, it\u2019s almost certain the phone will use the Kirin 980 processor, as Huawei is unlikely to replace it until later in 2019. It\u2019s possible the phone will <a href=\"https://www.androidpit.de/quad-kamera-5g-flagship-stores-huaweis-plaene-fuer-2019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">have 5G capabilities</a>, according to some rumors; but this may arrive on a modified version of the phone at a later date, with 4G LTE models being released first.</p>",
            "<p>The Huawei P20 Pro was announced in March 2018 at an event in Paris. Huawei may choose to launch the P30 at Mobile World Congress at the end of February 2019, or again decide to hold a separate event shortly afterward.</p>",
            "<p>We will update here with more Huawei P30 and P30 Pro rumors as they come in.</p>",
            "<p><em>Updated on December 27, 2018: We\u2019ve added the latest rumors that the fourth sensor on the P30 may be a Time-of-Flight sensor.</em></p>"

            "<p>It doesn\u2019t seem that long ago that the Huawei P20 Pro burst onto the scene with its stunning twilight finish, upping the ante for smartphone cameras everywhere with a triple lens setup. Yet here we are barely six months later with a new Huawei flagship sailing into view. The Huawei Mate 20 Pro is certainly bigger, but is it better than its predecessor?</p>",
            "<p>At first glance, these phones share a lot of similarities, but we\u2019re about to dig a bit deeper to uncover all the differences and help you choose between them.</p>",
            "<p>The newer Huawei Mate 20 Pro has Huawei\u2019s latest <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/huawei-kirin-980-news/\">Kirin 980 processor</a>\u00a0inside. Huawei\u00a0claims that it\u2019s 20 percent faster and 40 percent more efficient than the Kirin 970 which graces the P20 Pro. Both phones are available with 128GB of storage and 6GB of RAM or 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. Only the Mate 20 Pro allows for storage expansion via a card, but it won\u2019t take any Micro SD card, you will have to spring for one of Huawei\u2019s\u00a0proprietary NM Cards.</p>",
            "<p>Not only does the Mate 20 Pro have a bigger battery, it also supports much faster charging at up to 40W, giving you 70 percent battery life in just 30 minutes, compared to just over 50 percent for the P20 Pro. Just to seal the deal, the Mate 20 Pro also supports Qi wireless charging which the P20 Pro lacks.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Huawei Mate 20 Pro\u00a0</strong></p>",
            "<p>Both of these phones have notches at the top of the displays, but the P20 Pro\u2019s is smaller. They also both have bezels at the bottom, though the P20 Pro is starting to show its age with that lozenge-shaped fingerprint sensor, while the Mate 20 Pro has an in-display fingerprint sensor. The sides of the Mate 20 Pro are also more curved. On the back, you will find Huawei\u2019s gorgeous paint job \u2014 we especially love the twilight finish \u2014 but the P20 Pro\u2019s triple lens camera module definitely looks better than the big square module on the back of the Mate 20 Pro.</p>",
            "<p>Something Huawei has improved is the water resistance, with the Mate 20 Pro scoring an IP68 rating compared to the P20 Pro\u2019s IP67 rating. Both can handle a short dunk without damage, but the Mate 20 Pro can handle slightly deeper water. Neither is going to handle falls well, so you\u2019ll want to look at some <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-huawei-p20-pro-cases/\">good cases</a>.</p>",
            "<p>We\u2019re going to give the Mate 20 Pro the nod here, but we do think the P20 Pro looks better from the back.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Huawei Mate 20 Pro\u00a0</strong></p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll find top-quality AMOLED screens in both of these phones. The P20 Pro has a 6.1-inch display with a 2,240 x 1,080-pixel resolution which translates to 408 pixels-per-inch (ppi). The Mate 20 Pro has a slightly bigger 6.4-inch display with a 3,120 x 1,440-pixel resolution for a pixel density of 538 ppi. The taller display in the Mate 20 Pro isn\u2019t just bigger, it\u2019s also sharper and so it wins this round.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Huawei Mate 20 Pro</strong></p>",
            "<p>Huawei has stuck with a triple lens setup on the Mate 20 Pro, just like the P20 Pro, but there are some differences. The Mate 20 Pro has a main lens rated at 40 megapixels with an f/1.8 aperture, with an ultra wide-angle lens with 20 megapixels and an f/2.2 aperture, and a telephoto 8-megapixel lens with an f/2.4 aperture. On paper, the P20 Pro set up looks familiar with 40-megapixel, 20-megapixel, and 8-megapixel lenses, but the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/huawei-mate-20-monochrome-lens-replaced-by-filter/\">monochrome lens we loved so much</a> in the P20 Pro is gone. Huawei has essentially swapped the monochrome lens for a super wide-angle lens and the Mate 20 Pro camera is likely to be more versatile as a result.</p>",
            "<p>Both phones have a 24-megapixel front-facing camera for stunning selfies, but only the Mate 20 Pro offers proper facial scanning and 3D Live Emoji.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Huawei Mate 20 Pro</strong></p>",
            "<p>While the P20 Pro launched with Android 8.1 Oreo, Huawei has started to roll out the Android 9.0 Pie update. The Huawei Mate 20 Pro launches with <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/android-9-pie-review/\">Android 9.0 Pie</a> on board. Both feature Huawei\u2019s EMUI on top which adds various customization options and extra features. The software experience on these phones is going to be identical and we expect them to continue to get updates for a similar period of time, so there\u2019s no dividing them here.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Tie</strong></p>",
            "<p>Although most of the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/huawei-ai-kirin-970-npu/\">special artificial intelligence features</a> are available on both phones, powered by the dedicated neural processing unit, the newer Mate 20 Pro chip should prove faster and more capable. The Mate 20 Pro also supports much faster charging and a special reverse wireless charging ability that enables it to act as a wireless charger for another phone, though we\u2019re not sure you will want to donate your extra battery life very often. Factor in the FaceID-like, front-facing camera capabilities and the Mate 20 Pro is the clear winner here.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Huawei Mate 20 Pro</strong></p>",
            "<p>The P20 Pro was never officially released in the U.S. and it would have cost you close to $1,000 to import one when it was first released, but that price has dropped considerably and you can pick one up now for between $700 and $800. By contrast, the new Huawei Mate 20 Pro is going on sale at 1,049 euros, which is a staggering $1,220. There is a chance Huawei will release it stateside in the new year, probably for closer to $1,000, but we can\u2019t say for sure.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s more powerful, boasts a bigger screen, faster charging, and a more versatile camera, but the Huawei Mate 20 Pro is also considerably more expensive. The Huawei P20 Pro is still a strong flagship that outperforms many big competitors, so if you\u2019re choosing between these two right now, we wouldn\u2019t blame you for snagging it and saving the difference. If you already have a P20 Pro, the Mate 20 Pro isn\u2019t enough of a jump to merit an upgrade, but it is definitely the better phone.</p>"

You may not be alone and your Mate 20 Pro may have a gremlin or two inside. Here\u2019s our roundup of problems being reported regarding Huawei\u2019s otherwise very impressive phone.</p>",
            "<p>Multiple cases of people complaining their phone screens have taken on <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_responds_to_the_mate_20_pros_screen_light_bleeding_issue-news-34037.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a green tint</a>, that only gets worse, have shown up online since the phone launched. Often most noticeable against a dark wallpaper or in low-light conditions, the green tint spreads from where the side of the phone curves and can extend over the top of the display.</p>",
            "<p>Currently, Huawei has not issued an official statement on the situation, which has affected other manufacturer\u2019s phones in the past, although we have reached out to the company on the situation.\u00a0 A post on the <a href=\"https://uk.community.huawei.com/mate-20-series-20/mate-20-pro-green-edges-on-screen-679/index3.html#post3367\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Huawei Community forum</a>\u00a0unofficially suggested affected users contact an authorized service center for assistance.</p>",
            "<p>New technology can often be problematic, and while the Mate 20 Pro\u2019s in-display fingerprint sensor is one of the better ones, it\u2019s not perfect, and can become less reliable over time. If your fingerprint sensor is taking a few tries to unlock the phone, when it used to only take one, the best thing to do is re-register your fingerprint.</p>",
            "<p>The Huawei Mate 20 Pro has a notch at the top of the screen, and the available display either side of it is not very big, leaving room only for the permanent icons such as battery, time, network signal, Bluetooth, and NFC.

Turning off the notch under Settings will not cure this problem.</p>",
            "<p>Artificial intelligence has been used to enhance still photos on Huawei phones for a while, and the Mate 20 Pro adds A.I. features to video as well. It\u2019s possible to blur the background, isolate a particular color on screen\u00a0or even add live filters to the footage. If your Mate 20 Pro doesn\u2019t have these features, you may be running an out-of-date version of the firmware.</p>",
            "<p>Those are all the problems we\u2019ve seen frequently reported with the Huawei Mate 20 Pro so far, but if others show up we will add them to the list, and help out with possible solutions, too.</p>"

            "<p>At <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mwc-2019/\">MWC (Mobile World Congress)</a>, Chinese manufacturer Huawei showed off its new laptop, the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/laptop-reviews/huawei-matebook-x-pro-review/\">MateBook X Pro.</a>\u00a0And now, the laptop has been made available in the U.S. The base model will set you back $1,200, while the more powerful version is $300 more expensive.</p>",
            "<p>The design is stunning, but it\u2019s not a revolutionary. Instead, it\u2019s the fulfillment of a lot of the promises that laptop makers have been building toward for years. In particular, we noticed two trends from other manufacturers that the MateBook X Pro has borrowed, and taken a step further.</p>",
            "<p>The most striking feature of the MateBook X Pro is the bezel \u2014 or lack thereof. When the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/laptop-reviews/dell-xps-13-2018-review/\">Dell XPS 13 </a>first came out in 2015, we couldn\u2019t have known how big an influence it would have on the future of laptop design. Its shrunken bezels made just about every other laptop on the market feel outdated \u2014 in the same way that the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8-review/\">Galaxy S8</a> did with smartphones years later.</p>",
            "<p>The MateBook X Pro has taken that trend and played it out to its final form, giving us a laptop display that feels nearly edge-to-edge. The bezels around the edges are only 4.4mm on each side, the same as the new Dell XPS 13\u2019s bezels. The difference is that Huawei has also cut the bottom bezels, <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/matebook-x-webcam-poll/\">moving the webcam off the lid</a> entirely and giving the display a 91-percent screen-to-footprint ratio. The size of the bezels are almost Apple-like in their stubborn symmetry \u2014 and this time, not even a notch was necessary.</p>",
            "<p>Not only do those severed bezels make for an awesome viewing experience, they also make room for more pixels. Huawei smartly went with a 3:2 aspect ratio, providing a 3,000 x 2,000 resolution display that feels right on a laptop. Rather than fitting the same-sized screen into a smaller footprint, Huawei went for a larger display into the same overall dimensions. It\u2019s exactly what we wished Dell would have done on the newest XPS 13.</p>",
            "<p>No one\u2019s going to deny that the MateBook X Pro looks eerily similar to the MacBook Pro. It has a metal unibody chassis, a very familiar paint job, and even the exact same placement of its speaker grilles. But copying Apple is not anything new.\u00a0What Huawei has\u00a0done differently is borrow the best parts of the MacBook Pro \u2014 and diverge in its own interesting way.</p>",
            "<p>While the MateBook X Pro looks like no more than a logo-swap on the back of the lid, inside there\u2019s more going on. Unlike the MacBook Pro, it has a wedge shape, and the edges are slightly more rounded and smooth. That makes it feel smaller and more svelte than the blocky Pro.</p>",
            "<p>The laptop also takes the MacBook Pro\u2019s massive touchpad and plants it on a Windows 10 laptop. There\u2019s more to it than just looks obviously, but clearly it\u2019s something Huawei borrowed from Apple\u2019s playbook. This makes a lot of sense. Microsoft has improved Windows touch gesture support greatly with Windows 10, and it\u2019s now just as useful as MacOS \u2014 when paired with a good touchpad.</p>",
            "<p>While the MateBook X Pro takes inspiration from Apple, it\u2019s smart enough to reject what hasn\u2019t worked. Huawei offers a full USB-A port, along with USB-C, and doesn\u2019t waste time or money on a Touch Bar.</p>",
            "<p>Support for discrete graphics doesn\u2019t really play into laptop design \u2014 or does it? After all, laptops with discrete graphics cards have come in two variants in the past \u2013 large 15-inch laptops, or chunky gaming machines. Neither are conducive for taking your work or play on the go.</p>",
            "<p>This year, though, we\u2019ve seen laptops like the Asus ZenBook 13 UX331UN, which sports the Nvidia MX150 in a super-thin package that you\u2019d never guess could play games at decent framerates. It takes a tremendous amount of design and engineering to fit those kinds of components in a laptop this thin, especially when it comes to keeping it cool. The trend has continued with the MateBook X Pro, which includes the MX150.</p>",
            "<p>Although it doesn\u2019t come in the base model as it does with the ZenBook, Huawei has taken gaming on its laptop a step further by offering support for external GPUs. The inclusion of a Thunderbolt 3 port makes it possible, though many manufacturers block the ability to power up something like an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080.</p>",
            "<p>Taking the best from Dell and Apple, the MateBook X Pro has taken the promise of thin bezels, unibody design, and powerful graphics to its fullest potential.</p>",
            "<p>The $1,200 model boasts an eighth generation Intel Core i5-8250U processor with integrated graphics, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB NVMe PCIe SSD. The $1,500 laptop has an eighth generation Intel Core i7-8550U processor, 16 GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage,\u00a0as well as NVIDIA GeForce MX150 graphics.</p>",

            "<p>Following in the footsteps of last year\u2019s P10, the Huawei P20 brings a lot of exciting new features to the table. This year\u2019s flagship comes in three flavors: The Huawei P20, Huawei P20 Pro, and Porsche Design Huawei Mate RS.</p>",
            "<p>Here are all the details we have about the Huawei P20, and you can read our comprehensive review of the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/huawei-p20-pro-review/\">P20 Pro here</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/porsche-design-huawei-mate-rs-review/\">Porsche Design Mate RS</a> here.</p>",
            "<p>Is there anything that isn\u2019t improved by being wrapped in leather? Many will have different answers to this, but we\u2019d argue that the smartphone always gets an additional point if it has a leather back. Just look at the amount of leather cases there are in the world, the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/lg-g4-review/\">leather-clad LG G4</a>, and numerous <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/vertu-aster-review/\">Vertu (RIP) phones</a> for proof. Huawei is the latest to agree, and has added two leather-bound P20 Pro models to the range, and they\u2019re exquisite.</p>",
            "<p>There are two versions. A tan leather matched to a muted gold chassis, and a black leather with an almost gunmetal gray steel chassis. The black version oozes class, but it\u2019s the tan leather model that\u2019s most eye-catching. The leather doesn\u2019t feel thick, and has that wonderfully warm and tactile feeling we expect from the material. It closely follows the contours of the phone, doesn\u2019t bulge at the corners, and generally looks like it was supposed to be there from the start.</p>",
            "<p>The two leather versions are accompanied by two new non-leather colors: A different version of the original P20 Pro twilight color called aurora, and a pearl white. The pearl white is the more interesting of the two, and it gives the phone a softer, less aggressive style. The aurora reverses the color gradient of the twilight \u2014 so it shifts from top to bottom, rather than vice versa \u2014 and it has a slight rainbow effect in the right light.</p>",
            "<p>We are waiting for any price differences to be confirmed, and also on details of where and when these new colors will be available.</p>",
            "<p>In early June, Huawei president Kevin Ho announced the smartphone giant <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2150630/huaweis-triple-camera-feature-helps-propel-high-end-smartphone-sales\">shipped six million</a> P20 and P20 Pro handsets during their first 10 weeks on the market. This represents an 81 percent increase in shipments during the same period year on year. The company believes its focus on premium handsets and excellent camera equipment \u2014 especially the triple-lens P20 Pro \u2014 contributed to the remarkable growth in shipments.</p>",
            "<p>The P-Series is usually Huawei\u2019s \u201cfashion-forward\u201d smartphone, with an emphasis on design, and the Huawei P20 is no exception. It features an all-glass case that\u2019s curved on all four sides. The phones have a bezel-less display with an aspect ratio of 18:9. The P20 Pro and Porsche Edition Mate RS feature a triple camera array on the back, while the P20 has a dual-camera setup. All three phones feature a fingerprint sensor that sits at the bottom of the phone.</p>",
            "<p>The P20 and P20 Pro ship in four colors: Black, midnight blue, pink gold, and twilight. While all of the colors are attractive, the twilight model is a showstopper, with a gradient pattern that shifts from purple to teal. The Porsche Edition Huawei Mate RS color options are more limited \u2014 black will be available in all markets, while a limited-edition red case will be sold in China.</p>",
            "<p>The Huawei P20 Pro features a 6.1-inch OLED display with a resolution of 2240 x 1080. The Huawei P20 has a 5.8-inch LCD screen with the same resolution. The Porsche Design Huawei Mate RS features a 6-inch OLED screen. And yes, Huawei did decide to go with a top notch on all three phones. It appears to be solely a design choice, as there is a setting that can make the notch disappear by dimming the display around it.</p>",
            "<p>Along with the Mate Series of phones, Huawei\u2019s P Series represents the company\u2019s flagship devices, and therefore are packed with the latest tech. All three models feature the company\u2019s Kirin 970 processor. RAM varies depending on the exact model, with the P20 Pro and Porsche Design Huawei Mate RS packing 6GB of memory each, while the P20 comes in at 4GB. The Kirin processor features Huawei\u2019s Neural Processing Unit (NPU), which does most of the heavy lifting in terms of A.I. tasks.</p>",
            "<p>Both P20 models come with 128 GB of storage, while the Porsche Design Huawei Mate RS comes with a 256GB and 512GB storage option. None of the phones feature a MicroSD slot, so there\u2019s no option for external storage. As for battery capacity, the P20 and Porsche Edition Mate RS feature a hefty 4,000mAh battery, while the P20 comes in at 3,400mAh.</p>",
            "<p>There\u2019s also a significant durability difference between the Huawei P20 and P20 Pro. The <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-rugged-is-your-phone/\">IP ratings</a> are quite a bit different: The P20 has a shabby IP52 rating, meaning it won\u2019t handle much more than some dust and drops of water, while the Huawei P20 Pro has the more typical IP67 rating we\u2019ve come to expect on phones. The IP rating was not disclosed for the Porsche Design Huawei Mate RS.</p>",
            "<p>The Huawei P20, P20 Pro, and Porsche Edition Huawei Mate RS ship with Android 8.1 Oreo. You\u2019ll find the latest version of EMUI, Huawei\u2019s customer interface, on the phone as well. The EMUI update offers some minor improvements over its predecessor.</p>",
            "<p>Several phones in 2017 featured face unlock, including the iPhone X and the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-5t-review/\">OnePlus 5T,</a>\u00a0and Huawei added a similar feature to the new phones. The face unlock feature on the phones uses 2D mapping to authenticate users in just half a second. Like the iPhone X, the feature will also work in the dark. Unlike the iPhone X, the feature is not secure enough to authorize payments.</p>",
            "<p>Huawei\u2019s phone cameras have been great performers since the company began its partnership with Leica. How will it improve on the P20?\u00a0 Well, it looks like Huawei added some pretty impressive new hardware and software features to make the camera on the P20 its best yet \u2014 and camera sensor testing company DxO Mark confirms that the goal has been met.</p>",
            "<p>First things first: The Huawei P20 Pro and Porsche Design Mate RS are the first phones we\u2019ve seen with a triple camera array. They\u2019re equipped with a 40-megapixel main lens with A.I. Image Stabilization (AIS). The secondary camera comes in at 8 megapixels with Optical Image Stabilization, while the tertiary lens is a 20-megapixel mono lens. Each lens carries a different aperture from f/1.6 to f/2.0, meaning you should be able to get good shots in just about any lighting condition.</p>",
            "<p>The front-facing camera on the Huawei P20 Pro and Porsche Design Huawei Mate RS comes in at 24 megapixels and, like the other lenses, is Leica branded, which bodes well for overall quality. It features an aperture of f/2.0, which is pretty good for a selfie cam, just don\u2019t expect amazing shots in low light.</p>",
            "<p>As for the Huawei P20, you\u2019ll find a dual rear camera array with a 12-megapixel primary lens accompanied by a 20-megapixel monochromatic secondary lens. The primary lens features an aperture of f/1.8 while the mono lens comes in at f/1.6. Like other Huawei phones, the monochrome lens should help users get better shots in low light. You\u2019ll also find the same 24-megapixel Leica-branded camera on the P20 that appears on the P20 Pro.</p>",
            "<p>In addition to hardware, Huawei has added some interesting software features to its newest flagships. The camera relies on A.I. to make image adjustments based on object recognition; while the P10 could discern between 13 different scene-recognition modes, the P20, P20 Pro, and Porsche Design Huawei Mate RS up the ante by identifying 19 different common scenes. A.I. also helps with composition by adding a horizontal line to the viewfinder to ensure the shot is level.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll also find a super slow motion feature on these phones that are similar to what you\u2019d find on the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-review/\">Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus</a>. With super slow motion, you can increase your camera\u2019s frame rate to 960 fps for 0.2 seconds to get a Matrix-like effect.</p>",
            "<p>All that hardware has earned the P20 Pro <a href=\"https://www.dxomark.com/huawei-p20-pro-camera-review-innovative-technologies-outstanding-results/\" rel=\"noopener\">the highest DxO Mark smartphone rating yet</a>, with a score of 109. The plain P20 earns a still high, second-place 102. The DxO champions are getting shorter and shorter times on the throne \u2014 the P20 Pro replaces the previous top scorer, the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-review/\">Samsung Galaxy S9+</a>, after less than a month. Before that,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/google-pixel-2-camera-guide/\">the Google Pixel 2</a>\u00a0replaced <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-x-review/\">the iPhone X</a> as the top-scoring smartphone camera. DxO credits the P20 and P20 Pros\u2019 larger-than-average sensor, monochrome camera, and triple lens setup for that high score. The difference is so significant that DxO Mark says it looks like \u201cHuawei has skipped one or two generations.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>All three phones are available now. Pricing for the Huawei P20 comes in at 649 euros ($805), while the P20 Pro is available for 899 euros ($1,115). The 256GB version of the Porsche Edition Huawei Mate RS will sell for 1,695 euros ($2,103), while the 512GB variant will go for 2,095 euros ($2,600).</p>",

            "<p>The fact that Huawei has repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/senate-intelligence-committee-huawei-zte-news/\">run into issues</a>\u00a0trying to <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/huawei-att-discussions/\">break into the U.S. market</a> hasn\u2019t stopped the Chinese manufacturer from turning out some very impressive Android smartphones. The Huawei P20 and P20 Pro offer a compelling combination of cutting-edge hardware and software, but there are some big differences between the two. If you\u2019re considering buying one of them, then this comparison will help you get a grasp on where they\u2019re similar and where they diverge.</p>",
            "<p>Dissect either of these phones and you\u2019re going to find Huawei\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/huawei-kirin-970-ai-news/\">Kirin 970 processor</a> inside, along with its special\u00a0Neural Processing Unit (NPU), which is designed to offer all kinds of artificial intelligence (A.I.) enhancements without slowing things down or draining too much power. You get 6GB of RAM in the P20 Pro, while the P20 makes do with 4GB of RAM. Only serious multitaskers will feel the difference. Both phones have 128GB of storage, but there\u2019s no MicroSD card slot.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s easier to separate these phones on battery life because the P20 Pro has a 4,000mAh battery, while the battery in the P20 is only rated at 3,400mAh. The P20 Pro has a marginally bigger screen and a few more tricks up its sleeve, but we can\u2019t see that being enough to cancel out the extra capacity, so we expect the P20 Pro to have more stamina than its sibling. There\u2019s no wireless charging here, but you can expect both phones to support Huawei\u2019s SuperCharge fast-charging standard.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/go/94b3f00b49b0e2f655ecbdc36369621e07b93b6b/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" class=\" h-affiliate-link trackable\" data-event-type=\"affiliate-click\" data-event-action=\"manual\" data-event-param=\"Huawei\">Huawei P20 Pro</a></strong></p>",
            "<p>The all-glass, curved design of these phones is extremely attractive and they come in some interesting finishes, particularly the twilight option, which shifts from purple to teal. Strangely, Huawei has put the fingerprint sensors on the front, in the old traditional spot beneath the screen, but the main thing that jumps out is that notch at the top. We\u2019re not keen on the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/why-are-android-phone-makers-embracing-the-notch/\">notch trend afflicting Android phones</a>\u00a0right now, but if you\u2019re going to do it, there\u2019s nothing wrong with Huawei\u2019s implementation \u2014 the notch in the P20 and P20 Pro is much smaller than the iPhone X\u2019s notch.</p>",
            "<p>There\u2019s nothing to divide these phones on the design front, but if we delve into durability, the P20 Pro is clearly superior. The P20 has a distinctly disappointing IP53 rating, while the P20 Pro scores an IP67 rating. In simple terms, this means that the P20 Pro can survive submersion, but the P20 probably won\u2019t.</p>",

Strictly speaking, this makes the P20 screen a touch sharper, but the P20 Pro has a much higher contrast ratio, with rich colors and really deep blacks.</p>",

            "<p>The camera war in smartphones has reached new heights recently, as the battle for supremacy has spilled beyond megapixel count and led many manufacturers to adopt secondary lenses. Huawei is taking things a lot further with the P20 Pro by packing in three lenses: There\u2019s\u00a0a 40-megapixel main lens with A.I. Image Stabilization (AIS), a secondary telephoto lens rated at 8-megapixels, and a third 20-megapixel monochrome lens. This camera offers 3x optical zoom, which can be enhanced digitally to 5x. It also delivers incredible detail and solid low -light performance.</p>",
            "<p>By contrast, the P20 combines\u00a0a 12-megapixel primary lens with a 20-megapixel monochromatic lens. It may not have as many tricks at its disposal, but we still expect it to be a good performer. Both phones have front-facing cameras rated at 24-megapixels, which should be enough to elevate your selfie game to the next level.</p>",

Huawei\u2019s software is packed with clever A.I. tricks, enabling things like keyword search in the photo gallery app. There\u2019s no real difference between the two phones in this category.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Tie</strong></p>",
            "<p>Huawei is firmly focused on the triple-lens camera as the standout feature of the P20 Pro, but everything else you might point to as a special feature can be found on both phones. There is a face unlock option on the P20 and P20 Pro that uses 2-D mapping to authenticate users in only half a second, but it\u2019s not as secure as the iPhone X\u2019s Face ID, so you can\u2019t use it for payments.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Tie</strong></p>",
            "<p>This has been a very one-sided battle so far, but the P20 is able to score a win on price, because it\u2019s significantly cheaper than the P20 Pro. The Huawei P20 costs 649 euros (around $800), while the P20 Pro costs 899 euros (around $1,100).</p>",
            "<p>The phones are available globally now. The bad news is that the P20 and P20 Pro will not be released through carriers in the U.S. after <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/huawei-att-discussions/\">they were pressured to drop Huawei phones</a>\u00a0by Republican politicians, due to security concerns.</p>",

Spend <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-smartphones/\">over $500</a>\u00a0and it\u2019s almost assured that it\u2019ll be good. Great, even. So why cry over a phone from a brand you don\u2019t really know? It\u2019s simple: Choice. Having more choice is excellent for us, because it pushes companies to give us better prices and make even better devices in the future, because they\u2019re having to work harder to earn our support.</p>",
            "<p>Shutting out a manufacturer lessens that choice. Apple and Samsung must be chuckling away, because thanks to political and business machinations, they\u2019ve not had to fight a newcomer. The <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/huawei-p20-pro-review/\">Huawei P20 Pro</a>\u00a0isn\u2019t a perfect phone, but it\u2019s easily as good as any other phone released in the past year. Its camera is better than any other, and right now it\u2019s our favorite Android phone of 2018. It\u2019s absolutely worth your money. Like the Kinder Surprise, it\u2019s inviting, fun, and you can\u2019t buy one.</p>",
            "<p>You may be thinking, \u201cI trust these people saying Huawei and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/zte-android-ban/\">ZTE phones</a>, services, and infrastructure equipment are a potential security risk.\u201d It\u2019s a fair point, and inviting trouble wouldn\u2019t be sensible at all. You can read all about Huawei\u2019s denial of any government involvement and how it\u2019s privately owned \u2014 not by the state \u2014 on <a href=\"http://www.huawei.com/ucmf/groups/public/documents/webasset/hw_090305.pdf\">its site here</a>, but is there any truth to the accusations?</p>",
            "<p>Andrew Blaich, head of device intelligence at mobile security firm, <a href=\"https://www.lookout.com/uk\">Lookout</a>, told Digital Trends there are three factors at play:</p>",
            "<p>\u201cFirst, speculation fueled by fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Second, insider knowledge of something known, but the information cannot be revealed at this time. Third, a general guidance to minimize any possible risk in the future based on geopolitics or other factors.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>Is there any truth to Huawei hardware having backdoors that would allow governments to spy in its users? \u201cAs of now, there is no publicly available evidence that this has happened,\u201d he said.</p>",
            "<p>Additionally, Blaich said it\u2019s unfair to single out Huawei, adding, \u201cAll devices have some level of risk, which varies from device to device and manufacturer to manufacturer, all depending on the companies, developers, agencies, technology pipeline, app stores, or network operators involved.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>Does that mean we should just accept the risk? No, of course not, so how about looking at Huawei\u2019s relationship with the United Kingdom as a model for keeping everyone happy?</p>",
            "<p>Huawei is a major supplier of network infrastructure in the U.K., and its phones are available through <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-buy-huawei-p20-pro-uk/\">all the big-name carriers</a>\u00a0with or without a contract. It has a 13 percent market share, according to <a href=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/apple-leads-uk-smartphone-market-in-2017q3/\">Counterpoint research</a>, behind Apple and Samsung. To help assuage concerns over security, Huawei set up the the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC) in 2010 with the U.K. intelligence agency, GCHQ. In it, phones and network equipment are tested by Huawei employees, extensively <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/are-huawei-the-enemy-within-gchq-is-tightening-its-supervision-of-the-giant-chinese-technology-9013869.html\">vetted by the U.K. government</a>, and everything is reported to the CEO of the National Cyber Security Centre, which is a part of the GCHQ itself.</p>",
            "<p>\u201cThe Oversight Board concludes that in the year 2016-17, HCSEC fulfilled its obligations in respect of the provision of assurance that any risks to U.K. national security from Huawei\u2019s involvement in the U.K.\u2019s critical networks have been sufficiently mitigated,\u201d reads the HCSEC <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/626110/20170413_HCSEC_Oversight_Board_Report_2017_-_FINAL.pdf\">2017 annual report</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Huawei <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/07/china-huwaei-cell-uk-national-security-cyber-surveillance-hacking\">works with the U.K. government</a> in a sensible way to reduce fears. The result is more phones on sale, and a stronger, faster, more robust network on which they operate.</p>",
            "<p>Huawei didn\u2019t become the world\u2019s third largest phone maker and the largest supplier of telecoms equipment by not adapting. It\u2019s conscious of China\u2019s poor record when it comes to espionage, and it knows it needs to do all it can to convince governments and companies it\u2019s not a threat.</p>",
            "<p>Its success has come with a limited amount of exposure in the U.S. But it\u2019s a business, and selling phones and equipment in America means more profit, and a greater chance to become the world\u2019s number one phone manufacturer \u2014 a repeatedly-stated company goal.</p>",
            "<p>American phone buyers aren\u2019t just missing out on the P20 Pro; but also Huawei\u2019s investment and expertise in 5G network equipment. The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-washington-is-so-obsessed-with-chinas-huawei-1520373341\">Wall Street Journal</a> reported Washington is consumed with the idea that China will have wider 5G connectivity before the U.S., and wants to do nothing to assist in its technological advancement. It\u2019s a closed-minded approach that may see consumers suffer once again, and place more control in the hands of officials and carriers.</p>",
            "<p>The barrier has resulted in Huawei deciding to <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/huawei-refocus-efforts/\">leave the U.S.</a>\u00a0to get on without it for now. Current Huawei <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-looks-to-existing-markets-as-tech-becomes-target-in-u-s-china-trade-spat-1523966693\">CEO Eric Xu said</a> he \u201ccouldn\u2019t explain\u201d what was going on between China and the U.S., and that it was \u201cbeyond him.\u201d Instead, Huawei will focus on the places where it\u2019s already seeing success. And who can blame it?</p>",
            "<p>That\u2019s it. No P20 Pro for you. But if you want one, what can you do? Write to government representatives. Write to networks. How about going into <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/huawei-att-discussions/\">AT&amp;T</a>, <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/verizon-huawei-mate-10-pro-deal-news/\">Verizon</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-buy-huawei-news/\">Best Buy</a>\u00a0stores and asking for the Huawei P20 Pro? If enough people tell them, it\u2019ll get back to management. Or, <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-buy-huawei-p20-pro-united-states/\">why not import one</a>\u00a0and really thumb your nose at the establishment? It\u2019s not a choking hazard, so customs won\u2019t seize it. Alternatively, you could always not buy a phone through AT&amp;T or Verizon next time, and choose an unlocked <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-2-review/\">Google Pixel 2</a>\u00a0instead.</p>",
            "<p>Don\u2019t think this will make a difference? If 60,000 Kinder Surprise eggs were stopped at the border, imagine how many slipped through. This, and a subtle change in packaging by Kinder, resulted in the considerably more throat-friendly Kinder Joy being sold in American stores by 2017. If we\u2019re proactive enough, and refuse to take scaremongering at face value without evidence, perhaps Huawei\u2019s next phone (which <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/huawei-ceo-richard-yu-mwc-2018-interview/\">will have 5G</a>, by the way) and the network equipment it connects to will be vetted by a government-backed operation in the U.S., to make sure no one is listening in.</p>",

            "<p>The Huawei P20 Pro has been grabbing headlines because of its triple-lens camera, but it has plenty besides that to recommend it. This is a real, cutting-edge 2018 flagship with a price tag to match. But how does it measure up against its predecessor, the Huawei P10 Plus? A lot can happen in a year. Let\u2019s take a closer look and see how these phones compare.</p>",
            "<p>The snappy performance of the P20 Pro is down to Huawei\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/huawei-kirin-970-ai-news/\">Kirin 970 processor</a>, along with its Neural Processing Unit (NPU), which has a number of special artificial intelligence (A.I.) tricks up its sleeve and is designed to take the burden off the main processor. The P10 Plus has the older Kirin 960 processor and predates Huawei\u2019s push into A.I. There\u2019s no doubt that the P20 Pro will outperform the P10 Plus.</p>",
            "<p>You get 6GB of RAM in the P20 Pro, while the P10 Plus comes in two versions, one with 4GB of RAM and one with 6GB. The P20 Pro offers 128GB of storage, but there\u2019s no MicroSD card slot. The P10 Plus comes with 64GB or 128GB of storage and there is room for a MicroSD card, offering expansion by up to 256GB.</p>",
            "<p>These phones both boast big batteries: The P20 Pro has a 4,000mAh battery, while the battery in the P10 Plus is rated at 3,750mAh. The P20 Pro has a bigger screen, though the resolution is lower, so we\u2019d expect the extra capacity to tell. Sadly, there\u2019s no wireless charging support, but both phones offer Huawei\u2019s SuperCharge fast-charging standard.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/go/94b3f00b49b0e2f655ecbdc36369621e07b93b6b/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" class=\" h-affiliate-link trackable\" data-event-type=\"affiliate-click\" data-event-action=\"manual\" data-event-param=\"Huawei\">Huawei P20 Pro</a></strong></p>",
            "<p>These are both expensive-looking, attractive phones, but the P20 Pro looks much more modern than the P10 Plus. Huawei has embraced the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/why-are-android-phone-makers-embracing-the-notch/\">notch trend we\u2019re seeing in Android phones</a>\u00a0and created a gorgeous glass back in various colors. Unusually for a new phone nowadays, the fingerprint sensor is on the front of the P20 Pro, just like it is with the P10 Plus, but the older phone has much larger bezels above and below the screen. On the back, the P10 Plus has that distinctive camera module along the top, whereas the P20 Pro opts for three vertically stacked lenses.</p>",
            "<p>In terms of durability, the P10 Plus has a distinctly disappointing IPX3 rating, while the P20 Pro scores an IP67 rating. In simple terms, this means that the P20 Pro can survive submersion, while the P10 Plus is only equipped to deal with the odd splash.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/go/94b3f00b49b0e2f655ecbdc36369621e07b93b6b/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" class=\" h-affiliate-link trackable\" data-event-type=\"affiliate-click\" data-event-action=\"manual\" data-event-param=\"Huawei\">Huawei P20 Pro</a></strong></p>",
            "<p>The P20 Pro boasts a\u00a06.1-inch OLED screen with a 2240 x 1080 pixel screen resolution. The P10 Plus only has a 5.5-inch LCD screen, but it does boast a higher resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels. In terms of pixel density this means that the P20 Pro scores 408 pixels-per-inch, while the P10 Plus offers 540ppi. The P10 Plus screen is significantly sharper, but the OLED in the P20 Pro has a much higher contrast ratio, with rich colors and really deep blacks. We think the P20 Pro has the superior screen and it\u2019s also much bigger despite the body of the phone not being that much bigger.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/go/94b3f00b49b0e2f655ecbdc36369621e07b93b6b/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" class=\" h-affiliate-link trackable\" data-event-type=\"affiliate-click\" data-event-action=\"manual\" data-event-param=\"Huawei\">Huawei P20 Pro</a></strong></p>",
            "<p>We\u2019re not necessarily convinced that more lenses makes for a better camera, but Huawei clearly is. The P20 Pro has an unprecedented three lenses making up the main camera: There\u2019s\u00a0a 40-megapixel main lens, an\u00a08-megapixel telephoto lens, and a 20-megapixel monochrome lens. Put that together and you get a very high level of detail, powerful optical zoom, a solid bokeh effect for blurred backgrounds, and great low-light performance.</p>",
            "<p>By contrast, the P10 Plus combines\u00a0a 12-megapixel primary lens with a 20-megapixel monochromatic lens. We were very impressed with some of the photos we were able to capture with the P10 Plus, but there\u2019s little doubt that the P20 Pro is capable of more \u2014 we\u2019re just beginning to test so we can find out how good that triple lens camera really is.</p>",
            "<p>The P10 Plus has a typical 8-megapixel front-facing camera, but the P20 Pro boasts a selfie camera rated at 24-megapixels.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/go/94b3f00b49b0e2f655ecbdc36369621e07b93b6b/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" class=\" h-affiliate-link trackable\" data-event-type=\"affiliate-click\" data-event-action=\"manual\" data-event-param=\"Huawei\">Huawei P20 Pro</a></strong></p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll find the latest\u00a0Android 8.1 Oreo on the P20 Pro, with Huawei\u2019s\u00a0EMUI 8.1 user interface on top. The P10 Plus shipped with Android 7.0 Nougat and EMUI 5.1, though it has since been updated to Android 8.0 Oreo and EMUI 8.0. Huawei\u2019s Emotion UI is a real departure from stock Android, but it does offer some nifty tricks. The software experience on these two phones will be very similar, but the P20 Pro has slightly newer software and we expect it to get updates for longer.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/go/94b3f00b49b0e2f655ecbdc36369621e07b93b6b/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" class=\" h-affiliate-link trackable\" data-event-type=\"affiliate-click\" data-event-action=\"manual\" data-event-param=\"Huawei\">Huawei P20 Pro</a></strong></p>",
            "<p>Huawei is firmly focused on the triple-lens camera as the standout feature of the P20 Pro, though the camera was also a headline feature for the P10 Plus. There are no real standout extras that might be described as special features here, but everything you might point to in the P10 Plus, from the software to the battery life, is done better in the P20 Pro.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/go/94b3f00b49b0e2f655ecbdc36369621e07b93b6b/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" class=\" h-affiliate-link trackable\" data-event-type=\"affiliate-click\" data-event-action=\"manual\" data-event-param=\"Huawei\">Huawei P20 Pro</a></strong></p>",
            "<p>The P10 Plus has struggled to put up much of a fight here, but it definitely wins on price. The Huawei P20 Pro costs 900 euros (around $1,100), while the P10 Plus costs 700 euros (around $850), though you can get it even cheaper now if you shop around.</p>",
            "<p>We\u2019ve been fans of Huawei\u2019s phones for a while now, so it\u2019s shame the company has\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/senate-intelligence-committee-huawei-zte-news/\">run into problems</a>\u00a0trying to <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/huawei-att-discussions/\">crack the U.S. market</a>. Though you can\u2019t get either of these phones from your carrier, you can still buy them direct from Huawei and use them in the States on T-Mobile or AT&amp;T and they\u2019re widely available in the rest of the world.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Huawei P10 Plus</strong></p>",
            "<p>With a triple-lens camera, a superior processor, a better design, a bigger battery, and greater durability, the P20 Pro is the clear winner here. It looks to be an excellent phone that will surely turn a lot of heads. The only reason you might choose the P10 Plus is to save yourself some money.</p>"

After that, you just need to click\u00a0<em>OK i</em>n the pop-up window to approve the process.\u00a0When you can\u2019t uninstall an app, Android gives you the option to disable it. Disabling an app puts it to sleep and doesn\u2019t allow it to run in the background. It also erases any data and updates, restoring it to the factory version. To disable an app, go to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Apps &amp; notifications &gt; Apps.\u00a0</em>\u00a0Tap on the app you wish to disable and select\u00a0<em>Disable.\u00a0</em>If the app is running, you may need to select\u00a0<em>Force Stop</em> &gt;\u00a0<em>OK</em> before disabling the app.</p>",

A single tap acts as the back button, pressing and holding goes home, and a swipe to the right opens up recent apps.
