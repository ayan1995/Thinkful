            "<p>It\u2019s a firestorm of bad publicity for the company, but it\u2019s not the first time Huawei has suffered under the gaze of the international community. Huawei was founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, a former officer (specifically deputy director of engineering) in the People\u2019s Liberation Army. His military connections have significantly contributed to the rumors and accusations of the company\u2019s alleged misdealings.</p>",
            "<p>\u201cNot only is Huawei financially and politically supported by the Chinese government but also its origins as a military-backed company continue to pay dividends, including a contract to maintain the Chinese military\u2019s telecoms backbone,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.web.pdx.edu/~gilleyb/Huawei_FEER28Dec2000.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://www.web.pdx.edu/~gilleyb/Huawei_FEER28Dec2000.pdf', {metric25:1})\">claimed a piece in an issue of Far Eastern Economic Review published back in December 2000</a>.</p>",
            "<p>The standing theory is that Zhengfei is well respected still by military leaders, who toss the company good contracts and lean on the non-military side of the government to give Huawei contracts as well. \u201cIt also receives state support in the form of tax privileges and state-sponsored credit because it has been designated a \u2018national champion\u2019 of new technology,\u201d noted <a href=\"https://fas.org/nuke/guide/china/com84.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://fas.org/nuke/guide/china/com84.html', {metric25:1})\">an unclassified Canadian Security Intelligence Service report in 2003</a>.</p>",

            "<p>But it might not be up to him. \u201cBecause of the nature of the political system in China, you are naturally associated with the government and the government could put a lot of pressure on any firm in China to turn in data and to spy on other countries,\u201d Lynette Ong said. Ong is an Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Toronto and specializes in Chinese politics and political economy.</p>",
            "<p>As far as Ong is concerned, Ren\u2019s ties to the PLA are not meaningful. \u201cI haven\u2019t come across any hard evidence. There is a lot of writing, but it\u2019s almost speculative.\u201d For her, the concern is the company is simply based in China, and as such, it\u2019s subject to the same pressures as any other Chinese company, including others we regularly cover, like Xiaomi and Alibaba. \u201cHow do you actually prove that you are independent of your parents?\u201d</p>",
            "<p>So far, Huawei has struggled to prove that independence, and it\u2019s severely hampered its business, particularly in the U.S. While we\u2019ve been hearing about great Huawei phones for five years now, they haven\u2019t been sold by any U.S. phone carriers.

            "<p>\u201cThe U.S. definitely sees up and coming competition, and it is rolling out all the strategies possible to impeach the growth of its competitors,\u201d Ong said. Carolina Milanesi, a consumer technology analyst with Creative Strategies seconded this notion. \u201cThere is no question in my mind that the extra scrutiny Huawei has been under as of late has to do with the political environment between China and the U.S. as well as the high-stakes around AI and 5G,\u201d she wrote in an email to Gizmodo.</p>",

            "<p>After one of the most jam-packed product release seasons ever, all the big phones are finally out. But which one is right for you? Between multiple releases from Apple, Samsung, and Google, Huawei\u2019s continued global push, and old names like Nokia and <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/palms-ultra-tiny-phone-is-an-absolute-snack-1830528949\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/palms-ultra-tiny-phone-is-an-absolute-snack-1830528949', {metric25:1})\">Palm</a> popping up again, there\u2019s a seemingly an endless number of choices. And to make things even more daunting, with several phones pushing the $1,000 mark, making a hasty purchase can quickly turn into an expensive mistake.<br></p>",
            "<p>But don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve got your back because we\u2019ve tested and reviewed all of this year\u2019s most important phones so you don\u2019t have to. So here are our top picks for the best phone you should buy right now.</p>",
            "<p>What Google\u2019s Pixel 3 lacks in sheer specs, it more than makes up for in software thanks to incredible features like Night Sight, a built-in call screener, and all the other Pixel-specific tweaks that make Google\u2019s homegrown phones the smartest and most considerate handsets on the market. And with things like Google\u2019s AI-powered appointment booking service <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/i-broke-google-duplex-but-its-still-impressive-1827131546\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/i-broke-google-duplex-but-its-still-impressive-1827131546', {metric25:1})\">Duplex</a>, the Pixel 3 is only going to get better.</p>",
            "<p>Even after notches became all the rage, <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944#_ga=2.108489601.2086121615.1542667657-1681541265.1539891498\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944#_ga=2.108489601.2086121615.1542667657-1681541265.1539891498', {metric25:1})\">Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S9</a> is still easily one of the best-looking phones on the market. However, class-leading design isn\u2019t the only thing the S9 has going on. It was one of the first phones on the market sporting Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 845 chipset, and on its rear camera, Samsung created the first smartphone lens with a variable aperture to help capture best photos possible, no matter how much light is available. And while the S9 isn\u2019t the newest phone on this list, because it\u2019s been around for it, you can get a brand new S9 for as little as $520, or $640 for the S9+.</p>",
            "<p>Thanks to an increasing number of $1,000 phones, mid-range handsets have never been more important. And year after year OnePlus keeps pumping out affordable devices that are far and away the best handsets you get for around $500. And with the 6T, OnePlus is actually pulling further ahead thanks to a partnership with T-Mobile that puts OnePlus phones in carrier stores for the first time ever. And unlike previous handsets, the OP6T is the company\u2019s first device with support for Verizon\u2019s network too. You also get specs that match the best flagships out right now, an in-screen fingerprint reader, and a gorgeous OLED display with a notch that isn\u2019t offensively large.</p>",
            "<p>If the OnePlus 6T doesn\u2019t suit your fancy, consider the<strong>\u00a0</strong><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-xperia-xz2-is-the-best-phone-sony-has-made-in-years-1827049055#_ga=2.75377553.2086121615.1542667657-1681541265.1539891498\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-xperia-xz2-is-the-best-phone-sony-has-made-in-years-1827049055#_ga=2.75377553.2086121615.1542667657-1681541265.1539891498', {metric25:1})\">Xperia XZ2</a> and <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/finally-a-perfect-phone-for-small-hands-1827851267#_ga=2.75377553.2086121615.1542667657-1681541265.1539891498\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/finally-a-perfect-phone-for-small-hands-1827851267#_ga=2.75377553.2086121615.1542667657-1681541265.1539891498', {metric25:1})\">XZ2 Compact </a>instead. With a Snapdragon 845 chip, 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, the standard XZ2 has all the specs you want in a flagship phone for just $500. And featuring Sony\u2019s super powerful haptic vibration engine, the XZ2 has the power to add a rumble to pretty much any content you watch or listen to on your phone. Meanwhile, the XZ2 Compact might be the last bastion for people who still like small phones but don\u2019t want to compromise on specs or performance. And unlike it\u2019s bigger sibling, the XZ2 Compact is certified to work on GSM carriers like AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, and Verizon\u2019s CDMA network as well.</p>",
            "<p>Note: We considered putting the Pocophone F1 here as well due to its flagship specs and incredible value, we haven\u2019t had a chance to spend as much time with it as we\u2019d like. Also, due to its very limited support for 4G LTE here in the U.S., it\u2019s difficult to recommend.</p>",
            "<p>For years, Motorola\u2019s G-series phones have been the kings of the budget phone world, and the G6 is a latest and greatest example of Moto\u2019s dominance. Critically, the G6 boasts compatibility with all the major carriers, is available both unlocked and from brick-and-mortar wireless stores, and still retains important features like microSD card expandability and a headphone jack. Whether it\u2019s for a young teen getting their first phone, or someone who just wants something simple and reliable the won\u2019t blow your finances, the Moto G6 has got you.</p>",
            "<p>Starting at $350, the<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/preview/nokia-7-1-review-solid-budget-simplicity-1830529419\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/preview/nokia-7-1-review-solid-budget-simplicity-1830529419', {metric25:1})\"> Nokia 7.1 </a>typically costs $100 more than the Moto G6, but it\u2019s totally worth it. Because for the extra money, you get more base storage and RAM, better cameras, a bigger, brighter screen, and a much nicer design. And since the Nokia 7.1 is part of Google\u2019s Android One program, that also means its software and security updates are managed by Google, and you won\u2019t have to put up with any unwanted bloatware either. The major downsides to the Nokia 7.1 is that unlike the G6, it\u2019s only available as an unlocked device from third-party retailers, and it doesn\u2019t support CDMA networks like Verizon or Sprint.</p>",
            "<p>Like hypercars, hyper phones are handsets that are big, fast, and defined by excess. But if you want a phone that can handle everything home and work can throw at you, the Note 9 is it. It\u2019s got a big, gorgeous 6.4-inch display, ridiculous battery life that lasts upwards of upwards of 14 hours on a charge, built-in iris scanners and a secure folder to hide sensitive documents, and of course Samsung\u2019s S-Pen. The phone even comes with 128GB of base storage (and a microSD card slot), which is twice what you get from a similarly priced iPhone XS. And just in case that\u2019s not enough, you can even turn the Note 9 into a mini desktop by hooking up a USB-C to HDMI cable to a nearby monitor.</p>",
            "<p>While this phone isn\u2019t really an option for folks in the states since Huawei isn\u2019t making a U.S. specific variant, the sheer technical superiority of the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-20-pro-is-absolutely-loaded-1829779386#_ga=2.70094611.2086121615.1542667657-1681541265.1539891498\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-20-pro-is-absolutely-loaded-1829779386#_ga=2.70094611.2086121615.1542667657-1681541265.1539891498', {metric25:1})\"><strong>Mate 20 Pro</strong></a> can\u2019t be denied. That\u2019s because even though it lacks a stylus, it has pretty much every other feature you\u2019d ever need, and maybe even a few tricks you didn\u2019t even know you wanted. We\u2019re talking about full-on 3D face scanning tech, a fingerprint sensor that\u2019s built into the screen, a new 7-nanometer chipset with dual NPUs, and even wireless charging that can be reversed in order to power up other devices.</p>",
            "<p>With three new iPhones for 2018 along with two older models still on sale, choosing the right phone from Apple is actually a bit trickier than normal. However, with a somewhat reasonable (for Apple) price of $750, the same A12 processor, FaceID tech, and 64GB of storage you get from its more expensive siblings, the iPhone XR is our top recommendation for people who want a new Apple handset. As an added bonus, the iPhone XR also boasts battery life that\u2019s about an hour longer than the $1,000 iPhone XS, and it comes it a bunch of fun colors.</p>",
            "<p>For people who want a little more, the<strong>\u00a0</strong><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-xs-is-forever-1829305262\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-xs-is-forever-1829305262', {metric25:1})\">iPhone XS or XS Max</a> are the clear upgrades to the XR, just know that you\u2019ll need to shell out at least an extra $250 to get one. The main benefits when moving up to the iPhone XS and XS Max is a significantly more vibrant and higher resolution OLED screen that\u2019ll make all sorts of content look better, and a second rear camera with a 2x zoom to help bolster your mobile photo toolkit. Also, thanks to new stronger glass backs and an IP68 rating for water-resistance (versus the XR\u2019s IP67 rating), Apple\u2019s high-end iPhones should also be slightly more durable than the iPhone XR.</p>"

            "<p>If we judged the new Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro like Olympic figure skaters, they\u2019d no doubt earn 10s across the board for technical merit. That\u2019s because even though they don\u2019t have a <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-note-9-is-the-best-big-phone-1828348138\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-note-9-is-the-best-big-phone-1828348138', {metric25:1})\">built-in stylus</a>, Huawei\u2019s new flagship phone duo offers almost every other feature you could want, and I don\u2019t just mean the easy shit.<br></p>",
            "<p>We\u2019re talking full-on 3D face-scanning, a fingerprint sensor built into the screen, three cameras in the back (including one with a 3x zoom on the Mate 20 Pro), and even reverse wireless charging that can be used to top off your other gadgets. And with even more striking color options, a sleeker chassis, and class-leading specs, the Mate 20 earns high marks for artistry and execution too.</p>",
            "<p>I mean, just look at them. Especially when clad in Huawei\u2019s signature twilight paint job, it\u2019s not hard to imagine the Mate 20 out on the ice pulling off double axels and triple toe loops. Huawei even paid attention to little details both inside and out when it comes to things like the phones\u2019 brightly colored power buttons, or all the improvements in Huawei\u2019s EMUI 9 skin for Android. Unlike the <a href=\"http://1828348138\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://1828348138', {metric25:1})\">Galaxy Note 9</a>, EMUI is based on the latest version of Android 9 Pie and includes tweaks to help cut down on menu bloat, handy options like a built-in dark theme, and multiple ways to customize your UI.</p>",
            "<p>That said, it\u2019s a little disheartening to see apps like Booking.com and eBay pre-installed out of the box, especially on phones that start at around $1,000. I also noticed that when trying to search for key features like Huawei\u2019s Performance Mode, I wasn\u2019t able to find it by using the search bar in the settings menu. So despite Huawei\u2019s efforts to streamline the endless options in a phone and make things easier to find, there\u2019s still a room for refinement left in Huawei\u2019s routine.</p>",
            "<p>As for the various Mate 20 models, the Mate 20 Pro is the more luxurious of the two. Even though it offers a slightly smaller 6.39-inch screen (versus 6.5 inches for the standard Mate 20), the panel is OLED rather than LCD and slightly higher resolution, which results in sharper and more vibrant pictures and images. In a vacuum, both screens look good, but side-by-side, the difference is obvious.</p>",
            "<p>But more importantly, the Mate 20 Pro is the one loaded up with tech. It\u2019s got more base RAM, an in-screen fingerprint reader that feels even snappier than what you get in a <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/oneplus-6t-review-the-no-bullshit-best-deal-in-smartph-1830066240\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/oneplus-6t-review-the-no-bullshit-best-deal-in-smartph-1830066240', {metric25:1})\">OnePlus 6T</a>, and a useful notch that includes a 3D infrared dot projector that scans your face in much the same way Apple\u2019s Face ID. For people worried about security, this is a significant upgrade over the simpler 2D face recognition found on almost every other Android phone.</p>",
            "<p>And it\u2019s not all sparkly sequins and shiny tech either because the Mate 20 duo also sports an IP68 rating for dust and water-resistance and Huawei\u2019s new Kirin 980 processor and even built-in IR blasters for people who like being able to use their phone as a TV remote. It\u2019s the second time Huawei has pulled this stunt, but I still find it annoying that only the standard Mate 20 offers a headphone jack.</p>",
            "<p>Both Mate 20s also offer outstanding endurance, with the standard model posting a battery life of 15 hours and 15 minutes on our rundown test. That\u2019s a full hour better than a Galaxy Note 9 (14:11). And while its more expensive sibling didn\u2019t fare quite that well, thanks to an even larger 4,200 mAh battery, the Mate 20 Pro has enough juice to offset its higher-res screen and more power-hungry components and still pump out a superb time of 14:06.</p>",
            "<p>In normal usage, this means both phones will almost always have an excess of energy, so Huawei figured out a way to make those reserves useful by including reverse wireless charging too. And while finding the sweet spot to charge up other devices like wireless earbuds or even other phones can be a little finicky, this feature is something I\u2019d love to see on more phones in the future. It\u2019s so easy. Just go in the battery settings, hit the toggle for reverse charging, and them slam a Qi-compatible device onto the Mate 20's back. No wires required.</p>",
            "<p>But the highlight features in Huawei\u2019s long program are its triple camera in the back. For this review, I spent most of my time using the Mate 20 Pro, as the standard Mate 20 features an almost identical setup and similar image quality to what you get from the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-triple-camera-p20-pro-is-too-cool-for-america-1825647834\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-triple-camera-p20-pro-is-too-cool-for-america-1825647834', {metric25:1})\">P20 Pro</a> Huawei released earlier this spring. But the Mate 20 Pro steps things up with a new wide angle lens for all your big, open landscape shooting needs, the same 40-MP main camera as before, and a new 8-MP cam with a 3x zoom.</p>",
            "<p>Just going by image quality alone, the Mate 20 Pro is almost certainly the Pixel 3's biggest photo rival. But when you add in the capabilities of those extra lenses and sensors on top of all of Huawei\u2019s software tricks, the Mate 20 Pro has the biggest and most robust photo toolkit of any phone on the market. The number of photo modes alone is staggering, with Huawei offering options for things like light painting, timelapse, document scanning, and more. There\u2019s even an underwater mode designed for use with a special waterproof case, so you can snap pics while swimming. And if it wasn\u2019t for <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/googles-incredible-night-sight-mode-was-worth-the-wait-1830432540\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/googles-incredible-night-sight-mode-was-worth-the-wait-1830432540', {metric25:1})\">Google\u2019s newly released Night Sight mode</a>, Huawei\u2019s night mode would boast the most impressive low-light capabilities on the market.</p>",
            "<p>When it comes to the Mate 20 Pro\u2019s claimed 3x zoom though, I discovered<strong> </strong>something peculiar.<strong> </strong>According to its specs, the zoom lens features an 8-MP sensor, but when you hit the 3x button in the camera app and snap a pic, the resolution of the resulting image is 3648 x 2736, which is effectively 10 megapixels, and the same size as the pics you get from the phone\u2019s main cam. This makes you wonder how much data the Mate 20 Pro\u2019s 3x zoom lens is actually gathering, and how much info the phone is getting from the other lenses on back. What\u2019s even stranger is that the wide angle lens doesn\u2019t seem to suffer from this, as images captured by it are 5120 x 3840, which matches up with its 20-MP listed spec.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s possible that much of the heavy lifting is shared between the 40-MP main camera and the 8-MP zoom sensor, and that Huawei is using some sort of computational photography to hit that 3x zoom, but at this point, it\u2019s pretty safe to say that the Mate 20 Pro\u2019s zoom isn\u2019t purely optical in nature. I\u2019ve reached out to Huawei for more info on Mate 20 Pro\u2019s zoom camera, and will update the review if I hear back.</p>",
            "<p>But perhaps the biggest issue with the Mate 20 Pro\u2019s picture taking is when Huawei\u2019s AI photo tuning gets overly aggressive. It\u2019s distracting enough when you see colors pop in and out as Huawei\u2019s machine learning algorithms detect things like food or flowers, but in a shot I took of some apples, Huawei\u2019s Master AI made them look damn near radioactive next to a shot captured by a Pixel 3. Thankfully, you can dismiss these enhancements if things look wonky, or disable Master AI entirely using the toggle in the setting menus. I wouldn\u2019t do that, though, because when it works, pics snapped by the Mate 20 Pro defy their humble smartphone origins. It\u2019s that good.</p>",
            "<p>Really, after checking out the Mate 20 and Mate 20, that goodness permeates both devices. Even with all their innovative tech, you don\u2019t run into bugs or errors that you might expect from something this cutting edge. The Mate 20's biggest downside is price, which starts at around $1,000 for the standard version, and goes up to $1,200 for the Mate 20 Pro.</p>",
            "<p>However, like some of the most memorable figure skating moments, there\u2019s one last wrinkle when it comes to the judging. That\u2019s because after questions concerning Huawei\u2019s security and trustworthiness by organizations including the FBI and CIA <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/us-intelligence-chiefs-agree-huawei-is-not-to-be-truste-1822994091#_ga=2.76961045.1476345517.1541701931-1220318864.1537376527\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/us-intelligence-chiefs-agree-huawei-is-not-to-be-truste-1822994091#_ga=2.76961045.1476345517.1541701931-1220318864.1537376527', {metric25:1})\">made earlier this year</a>, Huawei didn\u2019t make a U.S. specific variant of the Mate 20 like it has for its previous three Mate-series phones. Technically, you can still buy the phone through retailers like Amazon, but only as an unlocked international model, which means the phone may not support carrier-specific features like RCS or wifi calling.<br></p>",
            "<p>So for many Americans, instead of the Mate 20 being a welcome and even more technically advanced alternative to the Apple and Samsung duopoly, the phone will probably end up with a DQ. That\u2019s a feeling that stings like a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voUMQrLy_uY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voUMQrLy_uY', {metric25:1})\">cheap shot to the knee</a> because the Mate 20 is a seriously good phone, but one that us here in the U.S. won\u2019t be able to fully appreciate.</p>"

            "<p>It\u2019s been a weird year for Samsung. While the South Korean giant managed to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/09/13/samsung-beats-apple-in-the-global-smartphone-market-as-chinese-brands-close-in/#1ec24357697d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/09/13/samsung-beats-apple-in-the-global-smartphone-market-as-chinese-brands-close-in/#1ec24357697d', {metric25:1})\">hold onto the top spot for global smartphone sales</a>, many of its Chinese rivals started closing the gap with Huawei CEO Richard Yu going so far as to say that <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/03/chinas-huawei-says-it-may-become-the-top-smartphone-maker-by-the-end-of-2019.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/03/chinas-huawei-says-it-may-become-the-top-smartphone-maker-by-the-end-of-2019.html', {metric25:1})\">Huawei could steal the number one spot</a> by as early as 2019. But the bigger issue is that as good as Samsung\u2019s phones were in 2018, so many of its products were overshadowed by things that won\u2019t be available until halfway through next year, <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-first-flexible-phone-could-cost-1-700-and-th-1830381704\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-first-flexible-phone-could-cost-1-700-and-th-1830381704', {metric25:1})\">assuming you can even afford them</a>.<br></p>",
            "<p>At the same time, Samsung\u2019s problems don\u2019t simply boil down to its competition getting better, because many of the company\u2019s issues are self-inflicted. Some of Samsung\u2019s major initiatives still haven\u2019t panned out, and in the ever-evolving smartphone world, Samsung failed to both lean into its strengths <em>and</em> shore up its weaknesses. Here\u2019s what went wrong with the Galaxy in 2018.</p>",
            "<p>By far the biggest issue for Samsung this year is the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944', {metric25:1})\">Galaxy S9</a>, which simply didn\u2019t offer enough improvements to entice the sort of people who buy new phones every year to upgrade. Thanks to Samsung\u2019s foundries, the GS9 was the first phone out sporting a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chip, while Samsung\u2019s display division ensured the GS9 also has the best screen around. But once other phones caught up, what were the GS9's most distinguishing new features? A rear camera with the world\u2019s first dual aperture lens on a smartphone, barely smaller bezels, and funky AR emojis. That\u2019s not nearly enough.</p>",
            "<p>While the camera addict in me loves the nerdy aspect of having dual apertures, the real-world results were just OK. Meanwhile, AR Emoji look like a shitty knock off <a href=\"https://www.bitmoji.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.bitmoji.com/', {metric25:1})\">Bitmoji</a>. But where the hell was the new design. Going back to GS5, Samsung offered noticeably sleeker designs on every phone. The Galaxy S6 ushered in the era of glass sandwich phones, while the S6 Edge featured the world\u2019s first dual-curved display, both of which are design statements that still influence the way phones look today.</p>",
            "<p>Next came the S7, which brought back the S5's water-resistance and microSD card slot and took the S6's style and turned it into something that looked like a sophisticated space pebble. And then came the S8, one of the best-looking phones ever made. Not only did it bring us closer to the bezel-less promised land than ever before, it still left enough room up top for front cams and an iris scanner without needing a notch, it also sported a clever virtual home button in place of the old fingerprint reader.</p>",
            "<p>Then the S9 came out, and it was sort of more of the same. Aside from moving the rear fingerprint sensor to the middle of the phone instead of off to the side (which if we\u2019re honest, was never that big a deal), the S8 and S9 are indistinguishable. To make matters worse, after a year of hate, <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-bixby-button-and-googles-assistant-squeeze-are-1820681623\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-bixby-button-and-googles-assistant-squeeze-are-1820681623', {metric25:1})\">Samsung didn\u2019t get rid of the Bixby button</a> or even make its function customizable. Samsung, if you\u2019re going to put a button on a phone that only does one thing, you better make sure that thing is fucking fantastic. Sadly, as any Samsung phone owner knows, fantastic is one of the last words anyone would use to describe Samsung\u2019s digital assistant.</p>",
            "<p>And when you expand the view to larger company-wide issues, Samsung\u2019s slowness to update its phones to the latest version of Android is downright embarrassing. Samsung is the biggest phone maker in the world, and recently took <a href=\"https://adage.com/article/news/samsung-overtakes-p-g-world-s-largest-advertiser/315743/?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://adage.com/article/news/samsung-overtakes-p-g-world-s-largest-advertiser/315743/?', {metric25:1})\">P&amp;G\u2019s position is the world\u2019s biggest advertiser</a>, and yet <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/android-p-is-now-officially-android-9-pie-1828133506\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/android-p-is-now-officially-android-9-pie-1828133506', {metric25:1})\">four months after its release</a>, not a single Samsung flagship phone has gotten an upgrade to Android 9 Pie. The only Samsung phone with Android 9 is the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/this-is-probably-how-samsungs-galaxy-s10-will-avoid-the-1830982111\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/this-is-probably-how-samsungs-galaxy-s10-will-avoid-the-1830982111', {metric25:1})\">mid-range A8s</a>, which isn\u2019t available outside of Asia and was just announced last week. When people talk about Android having a fragmentation problem, Samsung is one of the biggest reasons why.</p>",
            "<p>Software, in general, is still a weak point for Samsung. And even though the current Samsung Experience Android skin isn\u2019t nearly as bad as the TouchWiz used to be, given the success of the Pixel 3, software is a shortcoming Samsung can no longer afford. On top of that though, the Galaxy App Store is a mess, Samsung was late to the trend of using AI to enhance your photos, and its <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-s-new-theme-policy-sounds-like-some-bullshit-1830474527\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-s-new-theme-policy-sounds-like-some-bullshit-1830474527', {metric25:1})\">new policy regarding the use of free themes</a> in the forthcoming Android 9 update sucks. That\u2019s a damn shame because a lot of the user-friendly design choices made in OneUI sound good, but they still make up for the fact that it\u2019s way overdue.</p>",
            "<p>Even more concerning is that in 2018, it felt like Samsung got away from what it does best: class-leading, industry-defining hardware. On a pure specs comparison, aside from having a lower-res screen, the OnePlus 6T blows away the GS9 for $100 less. And while the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-note-9-is-the-best-big-phone-1828348138\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-note-9-is-the-best-big-phone-1828348138', {metric25:1})\">Note 9</a> and its built-in stylus remains the best big phone this side of the Pacific, the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-20-pro-is-a-technical-marvel-1830346004\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-20-pro-is-a-technical-marvel-1830346004', {metric25:1})\">Huawei Mate 20 Pro</a> offers full 3D scanning face recognition, reverse wireless charging, an in-screen fingerprint sensor, and three rear cameras\u2014all things that the $1,000 Note 9 doesn\u2019t have.</p>",
            "<p>Weirdly, one place where Samsung decided not to play it safe was with its ads. Because instead of doing the right thing and putting photos taken by its devices for use in promos, Samsung was caught, <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/08/16/samsung-brazil-tried-passing-two-stock-photos-off-galaxy-a8-camera-samples/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/08/16/samsung-brazil-tried-passing-two-stock-photos-off-galaxy-a8-camera-samples/', {metric25:1})\">not once</a>, <a href=\"https://www.diyphotography.net/samsung-used-my-dslr-photo-to-fake-their-phones-portrait-mode/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.diyphotography.net/samsung-used-my-dslr-photo-to-fake-their-phones-portrait-mode/', {metric25:1})\">but twice</a> trying pass off pictures shot on a DSLR as smartphone photos. I don\u2019t really care if the ads only showed up in Brazil, Malaysia, or anywhere else, the corner cutting and dishonesty don\u2019t reflect well well on the company\u2019s decision making.</p>",
            "<p>If Samsung wants to hold onto its top spot, Samsung needs to go all out. Give your flagship phone\u2014both big and small\u2014dual cameras, more RAM, and the kind of world-first features that make people remember how much innovation Samsung has inspired over the years.</p>",

            "<p>A few months ago, <a href=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/huawei-surpasses-apple/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.counterpointresearch.com/huawei-surpasses-apple/', {metric25:1})\">Huawei passed Apple</a> to become the second largest smartphone maker in the world, (Samsung\u2019s number one). Yet you don\u2019t see Huawei ads on TV in the United States, and its phones are seldom sold in any of the big carrier stores. Even when they are, they are often hidden behind a bigger brands like on the Nexus 6P. Shit, most Americans can\u2019t even say the name of the company properly (it\u2019s hwah-way, btw). The company isn\u2019t a known entity in the US, but that won\u2019t stop it from releasing new phones. Its latest flagship handset, the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro, comes complete with its own homegrown silicon that Huawei claims should make its smartphone the most intelligent.  It isn\u2019t.</p>",
            "<p>With its new Kirin 970 processor, our Mate 10 Pro review unit with 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage is definitely fast, and with a body constructed out of glass on front and back and held together by a polished strip of aluminum, the phone feels quite luxurious too. But after using it every day for more than a week, I\u2019m still struggling to figure out how the phone\u2019s AI, machine learning and built-in neural processing unit elevate it above a Pixel 2, iPhone X or any other \u201csmart\u201d phone.<br></p>",
            "<p>Part of the problem is that certain aspects of Huawei\u2019s programming  can only have a measurable impact months down the line. Huawei claims algorithms baked into the Mate 10 Pro should let you avoid the typical three to six-month post purchase slowdown. Maybe it will!</p>",
            "<p>There\u2019s also Huawei\u2019s partnership with Microsoft to provide a custom version of the <a href=\"https://translator.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://translator.microsoft.com/', {metric25:1})\">Microsoft Translator app</a>. It should be powered, in part, by the Mate 10 Pro\u2019s Neural Processing Unit. You take a picture of some text or simply speak into the phone, and the app spits out a translation for you likety split. But the app doesn\u2019t always get it right, and compared to using something like Google Translate, it\u2019s still unclear if the Mate 10 Pro\u2019s NPU gives a real advantage. </p>",
            "<p>Huawei also went the extra mile by including support for machine learning platforms such as <a href=\"https://caffe2.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://caffe2.ai/', {metric25:1})\">Facebook\u2019s Caffe 2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.tensorflow.org/', {metric25:1})\">Google\u2019s Tensor Flowlite</a> machine learning platforms, alongside their own AI framework. But that potential can only be realized after people have had time to develop apps designed to utilize the Mate 10 Pro\u2019s NPU. Which they haven\u2019t, so it\u2019s just <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/remember-when-google-tango-seemed-like-a-sick-idea-1798289705\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/remember-when-google-tango-seemed-like-a-sick-idea-1798289705', {metric25:1})\">another bet on a future that may, or may not pay off</a>. </p>",
            "<p>At least all the AI and neural processing works in the camera app. The camera can identify 13 different scenes or objects including flowers, plants, beach, food, nighttime, text, cats and dogs, and then automatically adjust the camera\u2019s settings to help you capture the best picture possible. You know it\u2019s working, because when the phone detects a subject it knows how to enhance, a corresponding icon will pop up in the camera\u2019s UI.</p>",
            "<p>Those little tweaks can make a big difference too. In a side by side comparison between the Mate 10 Pro and the iPhone X, Huawei\u2019s AI-powered camera added some real drama to an otherwise typical shot of a cold rainy night in NYC. The iPhone X\u2019s photo more or less captured what I saw, but the Mate 10 Pro\u2019s photo captured what I wanted to see. The sky in the Mate\u2019s photo had less of the hazy redness you see in the iPhone\u2019s pic, the various streetlights and decorations are sharper and less blown out, even the street looks wetter. Now some may say this blurs the line between accuracy and interpretation, but given the choice, I\u2019d pick the Mate 10 Pro\u2019s photo every time.</p>",
            "<p>However, other times, like when I snapped a pic of the Empire State Building, the AI failed to recognize anything it could enhance, even though it seemed like it should. Apparently it wasn\u2019t dark enough to classify as a nightscape, and the backdrop wasn\u2019t right for activating the phone\u2019s Blue Sky mode. But it\u2019s November in New York, it\u2019s going to look gray and dreary like this for the next four months, which means the camera\u2019s AI is useless if it can\u2019t adjust. To that end, Huawei says its constantly feeding more images through its machine learning software and hopes to update the its phones with new AI modes over time. But it could be slow going.<br></p>",
            "<p>That said, even when the AI doesn\u2019t step in an help out, the phone still has solid hardware to fall back on. It\u2019s the first phone  featuring two cameras with f/1.6 aperture lenses (the LG V30\u2019s main cam is f/1.6, but its wide-angle camera is not), and the combo 12 megapixel RGB sensor and 20 megapixel monochrome sensor still work together so you can adjust depth of field from super shallow all the way to infinity. The results are quite good too, often keeping pace with Portrait mode shots from the iPhone X. Although as seen in the NYC shots above, photos from the Mate 10 Pro tend to come out slightly underexposed compared to pics from Apple\u2019s $1,000 phone.<br></p>",
            "<p>So if the Mate 10 Pro\u2019s AI smarts, outside of photography, aren\u2019t all they\u2019re cracked up to be, what is it like as a \u201cnormal\u201d smartphone? Quite nice! The big 5.9-inch 18:9 OLED screen is vibrant and bordered on top and bottom by some deliciously thin bezels. There\u2019s also a fingerprint sensor around back, and IP67 water-resistance to make sure the phone can survive a quick dip or two. And it lasted 11 hours and 13 minutes on our battery rundown test, which is practically the same as the Pixel 2 XL (11:17), and noticeably better than the Galaxy Note 8 (10:21) and iPhone X (9:56).<br></p>",
            "<p>Huawei has even included a handful of nifty tricks, like the Mate 10 Pro\u2019s ability to function as a (Android-based) desktop PC just by hooking it up to an external display using a USB-C or USB-C to DisplayPort cable. From there, all you have to do is pair a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse and off you go. There\u2019s even a secret mode that lets you sign into different accounts on your phone depending on which finger you use to unlock it. <br></p>",
            "<p>There\u2019s still one big bummer. Want a headphone jack? Sorry, that\u2019s only available on the standard Mate 10, which by the way also has a higher resolution display. That\u2019s crap. The Pro should have everything the base model has <em>and</em> more. Let people who want to save money figure out what kind of compromises they are willing to make.<br></p>",
            "<p>Which brings us to price. Huawei says this phone is definitely coming to the US, but hasn\u2019t announced anything official yet. Based on the timeline for last year\u2019s Mate 9, I\u2019m expecting Huawei to make a splash with a US debut at CES 2018 in early January. And if it arrives costing around $800 like its Euro pricing would imply, we\u2019re looking at a pretty nice alternative to other 6-inch phones like the LG V30, Pixel 2 XL or even the Galaxy Note 8.

It features detailed renders that once again show a hexagonal, rear-camera layout with five lenses, a flash, and a yet-unknown sixth sensor that could allow the phone to shoot pics using all five cams at once. This could let users adjust the focus of a particular photo long after it\u2019s been taken.</p>",

However, unlike the Nokia 7.1, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any sort of notch, or even a real attempt to implement a full, bezel-less design like a lot of other modern handsets, which is actually kind of refreshing. </p>",
            "<p>Instead, the Nokia 9 looks to have small, but balanced borders on top and bottom, dual selfie cams, and an indicator light of some sort. Unfortunately, even though there seems to be a fair amount of room on its chin, the Nokia 9 apparently isn\u2019t using that space to tack on a second front-facing speaker. </p>",
            "<p>On top of that, the Nokia 9 may also join other Nokia phones as part of Google\u2019s Android One program, which means the phone would sport stock Android out of the box and would have software updates managed directly by Google\u2014good news for anyone looking to get away from the lethargic update cycle employed by Samsung, LG, and others. </p>",

            "<p>Additional alleged specs for the Nokia 9 PureView include a 5.99-inch 2K HDR10 display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset, 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and Zeiss optics, which will apparently work together with all those sensors to let the Nokia 9 gather \u201c10x more light\u201d compared to a regular smartphone camera sensor. And in a somewhat small but welcome upgrade, it seems the Nokia 9 will even feature an in-display fingerprint sensor instead of the company\u2019s traditional rear-mounted reader. </p>",
            "<p>But the biggest surprise here is that, instead of waiting to launch the Nokia 9 at MWC 2019 in late February, MySmartPrice claims Nokia is trying to get out in front of the other phone makers with a debut  sometime before the end of January, though there\u2019s no word on when the Nokia 9 might actually go on sale. </p>",

            "<p>Earlier this year, Huawei passed Apple to become the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-01/china-s-huawei-passes-apple-in-smartphone-share-for-first-time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-01/china-s-huawei-passes-apple-in-smartphone-share-for-first-time', {metric25:1})\">second largest smartphone maker in the world</a>, which is pretty impressive when you consider that the company\u2019s best phones like the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-triple-camera-p20-pro-is-too-cool-for-america-1825647834\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-triple-camera-p20-pro-is-too-cool-for-america-1825647834', {metric25:1})\">P20 Pro</a> aren\u2019t officially sold in the U.S. And because of the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/by-outselling-the-iphone-huawei-shows-it-doesn-t-need-1828033939\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/by-outselling-the-iphone-huawei-shows-it-doesn-t-need-1828033939', {metric25:1})\">current business climate</a>,  where largely going to miss out on Huawei\u2019s next big flagship too. It\u2019s a real shame these phones will be hard to find in the US, because it feels like Huawei is really going all out for its new Mate 20 duo.</p>",
            "<p>Available in two flavors\u2014the standard Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro\u2014the components in Huawei\u2019s new phones reads like a checklist filled with all the major smartphones trends. The standard Mate 20 sports a huge 6.5-inch FHD+ (2244 by 1080) LCD display with what Huawei is calling a \u201cDewdrop\u201d cutout at the top for its 24-MP selfie cam (it\u2019s a notch), while the Mate 20 Pro sports a more traditional notch that has a 3D face scanning dot projector (like the kind Apple uses for FaceID), a 6.39-inch QHD+ (3120 by 1440) OLED display, and an in-screen fingerprint reader.</p>",
            "<p>Yep, that\u2019s right, outside of handful of concepts and special limited edition devices, the Mate 20 Pro will be one of the fast mass-market phones to feature tech that so many companies kept promising, but never actually delivered. But that\u2019s just the start, because around back, both Mate 20's sport rather nice looking square camera modules with triple Leica cams. </p>",
            "<p>On the Mate 20 Pro, that setup is comprised of a 40-MP main cam, a 20-MP ultra wide-angle cam, and an 8-MP  telephoto camera with a 3x zoom that offers even more reach than the zoom lenses in an <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/apple-iphone-xs-the-complete-rundown-1828979967\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/apple-iphone-xs-the-complete-rundown-1828979967', {metric25:1})\">iPhone XS</a> or <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-note-9-is-the-best-big-phone-1828348138\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-note-9-is-the-best-big-phone-1828348138', {metric25:1})\">Galaxy Note 9</a>. Meanwhile, the standard Mate 20 offers slightly less ambitious camera specs including a main 16-MP cam, a 12-MP ultra-wide cam, and a 8-MP telephoto cam with just a 2x zoom. </p>",
            "<p>Inside, the fun continues because the Mate 20 is also Huawei\u2019s first phone to feature the company\u2019s new homegrown Kirin 980 chipset  that boasts a claimed 20-percent better performance and 40-percent increased energy efficiency, while also doubling down on the whole AI and machine learning hype with not one, but two built-in neural processing units (NPUs). </p>",
            "<p>Those NPUs, Huawei claims, gives the phone the ability to try out new AI-powered camera tricks like predictive auto-focus which uses the NPU to help better anticipate the movement of your subject, or selective color mode which uses the NPU to  detect people and automatically change the pictures background to black-and-white while keeping the person in full color, all in real-time. In my brief time with the devices, both new camera features worked as advertised, even in the cramped and awkwardly lit demo room, though it\u2019s still a bit too early to say Huawei nailed it just yet.</p>",
            "<p>And in terms of pure specs, the Mate 20 Pro is pushing battery capacity even further with a huge 4,200 mAh power pack, along with a healthy 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, microSD card slot, and a blazing 40-watt fast charge system. That\u2019s more than twice the speed of the typical 18-watt fast charging found is most Android phones. And with all the extra battery, Huawei even included reverse wireless charging that can be used to fill up other  devices using the Mate 20. </p>",
            "<p>The Mate 20 even includes wireless screen mirroring to nearby TVs and monitors via Miracast, and an IR blaster, which has become a rarity even among flagship devices nowadays. Annoyingly, only the standard Mate 20 offers a headphone jack.</p>",
            "<p>However, what\u2019s most interesting to me is that the actual design of the Mate 20. In the past, Huawei has often cribbed aspects of iPhone aesthetics, but this time, it seems Huawei was inspired by Samsung, because aside from their notches Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro look and feel quite similar to a <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944', {metric25:1})\">Galaxy S9</a>. </p>",
            "<p>The back of the phone even features a subtle micro-texture that looks smooth, but actually feels like the ridges on a vinyl record. And in keeping with the gorgeous color options on the P20 Pro, the Mate 20 comes in a bunch of lovely hues and shades including emerald green, midnight blue, black, and pink gold. There\u2019s even a new twilight gradient. </p>",
            "<p>On the Mate 20 Pro, Huawei is really is throwing everything it can into its new phone, which is interesting, because it\u2019s almost the exact opposite strategy <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/google-pixel-3-review-the-other-way-to-make-a-killer-p-1829749807\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/google-pixel-3-review-the-other-way-to-make-a-killer-p-1829749807', {metric25:1})\">Google took on the Pixel 3</a>, which has largely side-stepped the traditional specs arms race in favor of focusing on  the phone\u2019s software. </p>",
            "<p>Now here comes the bad part, because while the Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro will be available for purchase in the U.S. through select online retailers, the models we\u2019ll get are the standard unlocked international versions. That means no support for CDMA carriers like Verizon and Sprint, and at this time, unknown compatibility for advanced 4GLTE features like carrier aggregation on GSM networks. So even if you can get your hands on a Mate 20 in the States, its wireless speeds might be handicapped in comparison to other handsets, despite having what should be a super fast CAT 21 gigabit modem.</p>",
            "<p>The Mate 20 and Mate Pro should be available sometime later year, and while we don\u2019t have an official price or release date yet, if the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-10-pro-is-a-valiant-attempt-to-slay-the-ip-1820480251\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-10-pro-is-a-valiant-attempt-to-slay-the-ip-1820480251', {metric25:1})\">Mate 10</a> and P20 are any indication, they won\u2019t be cheap. </p>",
            "<p><strong>[Update: 10 AM ET]</strong> Here are the official European prices for the Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro. The Mate 20 starts at 800 euros (around $925) for the 4GB/128GB model , while the Mate 20 Pro starts at 1050 euros (around $1,215) for the 6GB/128GB version. And as Huawei has done in past, there\u2019s also an even more expensive Porsche Design version of the Mate 20 Pro with a leather back, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for a whopping 1,700 euros, which converts to just shy of $2,000. Yikes.</p>"

LG and Huawei are also rumored to be working on their own bendy phones. But among all the leaks and rumors, a mysterious video of an unreleased bendy screen device might be the most exciting example of flexible display tech yet. </p>",
            "<p><span class=\"twitter-embed\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" scrolling=\"no\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" data-src=\"/ajax/inset/iframe?id=twitter-1080870489990590464&amp;autosize=1\" height=\"159\" id=\"twitter-1080870489990590464\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitAllowFullScreen\" class=\"core-inset lazyload\" width=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span></p>",
            "<p>According to a video uploaded to Twitter by  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1080870489990590464\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1080870489990590464', {metric25:1})\">@evleaks</a>, the unnamed device was possibly produced by Chinese phone giant Xiaomi, and from the clip looks to be quite legit. Rumors have been swirling that Google has teamed up with an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hallstephenj/status/1043154397675573250\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://twitter.com/hallstephenj/status/1043154397675573250', {metric25:1})\">\u201cunusual\u201d partner</a> for a yet-unreleased device, and with what looks like a Chinese version of Google Maps running on the screen, it\u2019s possible this is it. But what\u2019s even more important than the simple existence of another flexible screen device is the way this particular gadget actually bends. </p>",
            "<p>Instead of featuring two halves that can be opened up to create a larger display like Samsung\u2019s prototype (or even the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/zte-s-ambitious-dual-screen-phone-shouldnt-exist-1820933104\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/zte-s-ambitious-dual-screen-phone-shouldnt-exist-1820933104', {metric25:1})\">dual-screen Axon M</a>), this mysterious video shows off a tri-fold design with a central display area in the middle, and flaps on either side that can folded behind as needed.</p>",
            "<p>The use of two folds instead of one offers a significant advantage because normally, when you double a regular 16:9 or 18:9 aspect ratio display, you end up with something squarish. This often leaves you with a lot of wasted space when watching movies and an awkward layout when doing everything else as phones are still based largely around displays with widescreen dimensions. </p>",
            "<p>While this mysterious device doesn\u2019t look like it has an exact 16:9 screen ratio when fully unfolded, it seems a lot less unwieldy than any flexible-screen device we\u2019ve seen yet. On top of that, the action of folding the phone looks quite smooth and doesn\u2019t feature any  flickering or lag often seen on less advanced hardware. Seriously, this thing looks damn good. </p>",
            "<p>That said, there are a few concerns that this and other bendable screen phones will need to address. The first is one of battery life, because with that much additional screen real estate, even the 4,000 to 4,200 mAh batteries found in phones like the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-note-9-is-the-best-big-phone-1828348138\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-note-9-is-the-best-big-phone-1828348138', {metric25:1})\">Galaxy Note 9</a> and <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-20-pro-is-a-technical-marvel-1830346004#_ga=2.2693936.1033528596.1546439231-1220318864.1537376527\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-20-pro-is-a-technical-marvel-1830346004#_ga=2.2693936.1033528596.1546439231-1220318864.1537376527', {metric25:1})\">Huawei Mate 20 Pro</a> might not be enough to supply a full day of use. </p>",
            "<p>As for this particular device, there are also little things like the tiny bumps at each fold that can been seen even when the gadget\u2019s display is fully open. This seems like a result of the phone\u2019s bendable screen not lying completely flat when opened up, which could be more noticeable and therefore annoying when viewed in better lighting. </p>",
            "<p>Also, while a few extra millimeters here are there aren\u2019t usually a big deal, with a screen that folds on either side and presumably some guts and a battery behind the middle section, this unnamed phone could end up being seriously thick. </p>",
            "<p>But right now, none of that really matters. This thing looks sweet and I just want to know more about it and\u2014assuming it\u2019s real\u2014when it\u2019s going to be available.

That left Huawei\u2019s latest flagship phone\u2014the P20 Pro\u2014in a weird place, because instead of potentially being the first P-series phone to get sold in America,  we\u2019re left <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_p20_pro_becomes_the_companys_bestselling_phone_in_western_europe-news-30759.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_p20_pro_becomes_the_companys_bestselling_phone_in_western_europe-news-30759.php', {metric25:1})\">watching it thrive overseas</a> with no hopes of a stateside release. And that\u2019s a damn shame, because with a gorgeous design and an innovative triple camera setup, the P20 Pro is actually a pretty great device.</p>",
            "<p>Even just looking at the specs, you can see where Huawei made a lot of smart decisions. Featuring a Kirin 970 processor, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage as standard. (There\u2019s no microSD expandability, but who really cares these days.) Meanwhile the dual SIM tray is a boon for frequent travelers. But P20 Pro\u2019s real treat is its giant 4,000 mAh battery. On our battery rundown test, the P20 Pro lasted 11 hours and 36 minutes. That\u2019s better than even the Pixel 2 XL (11:17), though  still slightly short of the S9+\u2019s time of 12:27, which remains the best time we\u2019ve recorded yet this year. </p>",
            "<p>Then there are other little things like the IR blaster embedded in the top edge of the device, which is feature that used to be quite common, but almost every phone maker has long abandoned. And as you\u2019d expect from a phone of this caliber and price, you get IP67 water-resistance and some pleasantly powerful stereo speakers. </p>",
            "<p class=\"has-video media-large video-embed align--bleed\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" scrolling=\"no\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" data-src=\"/ajax/inset/iframe?id=mcp-3510753&amp;sponsored=false&amp;post_id=1825647834&amp;platform=web&amp;postPosition=0&amp;cloudinaryImageOverride=tszvqslr2xawjbywnjqm&amp;cloudinaryImageOverrideFormat=JPG\" data-recommend-id=\"mcp://3510753\" height=\"450\" id=\"mcp-3510753\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitAllowFullScreen\" class=\"core-inset lazyload\" width=\"800\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span></p>",
            "<p>That said, the P20 Pro still has two big sticking points: the lack of a headphone jack and wireless charging. Being forced to use USB audio is something you can mull over yourself, you can either deal with it or you can\u2019t. But no wireless charging is a strange omission considering the phone\u2019s 900 euro price tag, which translates to around $1,100. Unlike last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/05/huawei-p10-australian-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/05/huawei-p10-australian-review/', {metric25:1})\">P10,</a> whose metal back made it difficult for the phone to play nice with wireless charging tech, the P20\u2019s back is a big sheet of glass. For a phone this expensive, there\u2019s really no excuse. <br></p>",
            "<p>Perhaps Huawei\u2019s plan was to dazzle users with one of sparkling colors. With an entrancing color shift from green to purple, Huawei\u2019s signature<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-new-triple-camera-smartphone-could-start-a-tech-1824093276\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-new-triple-camera-smartphone-could-start-a-tech-1824093276', {metric25:1})\"> Twilight</a> paint job looks like nothing else out there. But even in the standard blue of our review unit, the P20 Pro is just as sharp. </p>",
            "<p>Now I know some people might take issue with Huawei\u2019s use of a notch, but there really isn\u2019t anything to complain about. Out of the box, the cut out for the P20 Pro 20-MP front-facing camera is pretty obvious. But if you\u2019re not a fan, there\u2019s an option in the display settings to mask the notch with black bars on either side. This gives you the ability to see your notifications and time, date, and battery like you would normally, but without having something protruding into the screen, and in my opinion, it\u2019s the best blend of form and function.<br></p>",
            "<p>But enough with all the dilly dallying, how bout those cameras? Sporting a 20-MP black-and-white camera, a massive 40-MP RGB camera, and a 8-MP camera with a 3X zoom, Huawei\u2019s world-first camera arrangement has something for everyone. </p>",
            "<p>Using the monochrome cam, even on something as simple as a black and white photo, the P20 Pro easily out shot the Galaxy S9 in gray scale mode. Frankly, it\u2019s not even  close, as the P20 Pro\u2019s captured much better details and sharper edges versus the complete oversaturation seen in the S9\u2019s pic. And these abilities aren\u2019t relegated just to black-and-white shots either.</p>",
            "<p>When using the 40-MP RGB camera, which is what the phone relies on most of the time, the P20 Pro uses the monochrome camera to help capture fine details, while the 40-MP camera concentrates on colors and everything else. On top of that, the P20 Pro\u2019s 40-MP sensor uses a quad <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter', {metric25:1})\">bayer filter</a> which creates groups of four pixels and essentially combines them into one giant pixel, which lets the camera soak up a ton of light. So in the end, the phone spits out pictures that are just 10-MP in resolution, which are just slightly smaller than the 12-MP rear cameras in Pixel 2 XL and Galaxy S9, but not by much. And what you get in exchange for the loss in overall resolution is totally worth it.</p>",
            "<p>Just take a look at how the S9 and P20 Pro snapped a pic of some plums. The S9\u2019s shot isn\u2019t bad, but the P20 Pro\u2019s pic has it beat it almost every single way: sharpness, color, detail, you name it. The most obvious example is when you zoom in to look at the labels on the fruit. The barcode and lettering in the S9\u2019s photo looks a little fuzzy, while in the P20 Pro\u2019s pic, lines are bold and crisp. Now I must point out that the P20 Pro\u2019s pic is probably a little oversharpened, but it still beats the S9\u2019s version hands down.</p>",
            "<p>And in low-light things get even better, because that quad bayer arrangement lets the P20 Pro hang with the S9, despite having a smaller f/1.7 aperture compared to the S9\u2019s industry-leading f/1.5 iris. </p>",
            "<p>But then, Huawei went the extra step and created an incredible low-light mode that captures four-second  long-exposure shots that can be taken even while hand held. That\u2019s right, no tripod needed. Now normally, this would cause streaks all over the place (and if people move around too fast, you still get a little motion blur), but on the P20 Pro, you get a sort of specialized nighttime HDR shots that often look shockingly good. </p>",
            "<p>Finally, there\u2019s that 8-MP camera with a 3x optical zoom, which is 1x more than what you get on the iPhone X or Galaxy S9. So when you need that little extra reach, like say when you\u2019re at a ballgame or concert, the P20 Pro has got you covered there too.<br></p>",
            "<p>However, the P20 Pro\u2019s cameras aren\u2019t without their flaws. Like the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-10-pro-is-a-valiant-attempt-to-slay-the-ip-1820480251\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-10-pro-is-a-valiant-attempt-to-slay-the-ip-1820480251', {metric25:1})\">Mate 10 Pro</a>. the P20 Pro has the ability to use object recognition to identify things like dogs, plants, and food, or scenes like landscape and blue sky, and then use that info to fine tune the camera settings for optimal results. The problem is that it seems in the six moths since Huawei\u2019s last iteration, the company may have pushed its algorithms a little too far. </p>",
            "<p>For example, when I snapped very typical shot of some flowers, the P20 Pro pumped up saturation of greens and yellows to an absurd degree, to the point where the pic almost looks neon. You can also kind of see in the clock photo above, where the blue-sky mode does a little bit too good of a job making those blues stand out. Thankfully, disabling the auto-tuning is as simple as hitting the little \u201cx\u201d next to the object recognition tag in the camera app.</p>",
            "<p>But here\u2019s the real tragedy, Huawei isn\u2019t selling the P20 Pro in the states, and based on pressure from seemingly everly level of the government, there\u2019s almost no chance that will change. In fact, just four months in, it seems Huawei may have already decided to reconsider is expansion into the US, in favor of <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-looks-to-existing-markets-as-tech-becomes-target-in-u-s-china-trade-spat-1523966693\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-looks-to-existing-markets-as-tech-becomes-target-in-u-s-china-trade-spat-1523966693', {metric25:1})\">refocusing its efforts</a> on more welcoming markets like Europe and Asia. That means like all those fancy cheeses made in France and elsewhere, or genuine Kobe beef from Japan, the Huawei P20 Pro is a delicacy only available overseas. That\u2019s pretty depressing, because this is an exciting, innovative phone that gives Apple, Samsung, and Google\u2019s best some actual competition. And the worst part about all this, is that we really only have ourselves to blame.</p>",

            "<p>I have a friend who often likes to joke about the pointlessness of dual cameras. And even though I know his jabs are often said in jest, there\u2019s a bit of truth in there too. I mean really, how much better is two cameras than one? Well just as we were getting used to two cameras, Chinese phone giant Huawei is kicking off a whole new race to fill the entire backside of phones with cameras starting with the triple cam arrangement on the new P20 Pro. </p>",
            "<p>Available in standard and Pro variants, the P20 feels like Huawei is attempting to cram every major tech trend into a glorious feature fiesta that can please even the most demanding hypbeast. </p>",
            "<p>Like seemingly <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/after-just-6-months-the-phone-notch-is-already-deeply-1823469447\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/after-just-6-months-the-phone-notch-is-already-deeply-1823469447', {metric25:1})\">every new flagship phone</a>, the P20 sports a glass-sandwich design with minimal bezels, a fingerprint reader, a notch cut out of the top display, no headphone jack, and a bunch of AI smarts inside. And I alluded to before, the Pro model takes things even further with not one, not two, but three rear cameras. Even the P20 Pro\u2019s colorways are especially swanky thanks to a pair of stunning finishes that uses color-shifting gradient like you used to see on cars with the chameleon paints jobs that were all the rage back in the mid 2000's. </p>",
            "<p>Really, the only fashionable feature missing from the P20  is some kind of 3D face-scanning tech like you get on the iPhone X. Instead, Huawei settled for a much less sophisticated (and less secure) 2D face unlocking system. But hey, at least it\u2019s fast, so there\u2019s that. </p>",
            "<p>All joking aside, Huawei\u2019s fervor to push every aspect of the phone to its limits could result in some pretty important advancements for the smartphone industry as a whole. The most obvious example of this is the P20 Pro\u2019s triple rear cameras, which is comprised of an 8-MPl sensor with a 3x optical zoom, a 20-MP monochrome sensor, and a whopping 40-MP main RGB sensor.</p>",
            "<p>Now some people might balk at a phone camera with a resolution that high, because simply chasing more megapixels isn\u2019t always a productive way to improve image quality. However, that increased resolution also comes with an increased sensor size, that according to Huawei is more than twice as big as the main cam in the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/i-hate-how-much-i-love-the-iphone-x-1820086867\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/i-hate-how-much-i-love-the-iphone-x-1820086867', {metric25:1})\">iPhone X</a>, and 170 percent larger than the one in the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944', {metric25:1})\">Galaxy S9</a>. </p>",
            "<p>Then you add in a new laser autofocus system with an improved range of nearly 10 feet (three times farther then before), a new color temperature sensor for more accurate white balance, 960 fps slow-mo like you get on the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944', {metric25:1})\">Galaxy S9</a>, and a 3x zoom that\u2019s 1x better than Samsung and Apple\u2019s best, and you\u2019re looking at some pretty serious camera specs.</p>",
            "<p>Meanwhile, on the inside, Huawei has continued to work on its AI image wizardy too. Not only can the P20 identify more individual objects like a cat or a dog than the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-10-pro-is-a-valiant-attempt-to-slay-the-ip-1820480251\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-10-pro-is-a-valiant-attempt-to-slay-the-ip-1820480251', {metric25:1})\">Mate 10 Pro</a> could last fall, the phone can now recognize entire scenes like blue sky or nighttime and adjust the camera\u2019s settings to match. </p>",
            "<p>But the P20's wildest claim might be the phone\u2019s new AI-enhanced stabilization that lets you take handheld long exposure shots of up to four seconds without showing a hint of shake or motion blur. It\u2019s a feature that sounds almost too cool to be true, as it would let the average person capture dramatic nighttime shots without needing to carry around a big, expensive camera and a tripod all the time. But unfortunately though not entirely unexpectedly, that is the one feature I didn\u2019t actually get to use during my brief time testing out the phone. That\u2019ll have to wait for the review. <br></p>",
            "<p>As for the camera on the standard P20 , which stands at just 20-MP rather than 40, Huawei says its big 1.55 micron pixels (22 percent larger than the S9's 1.4 micron pixels) give it an edge in low-light against pretty much every other phone on the market. After all, larger pixels can soak up more light than smaller ones, which theoretically should improve the quality of photos taken in the dark. </p>",
            "<p>That said, the P20 and P20 Pro aren\u2019t phone that have traded in all of Huawei\u2019s traditional tricks in for the sake of the camera. Take that notch up top for example. Out of the box, it looks like every phone with a weird new hairdo. but if you want, there\u2019s a setting that let\u2019s you put some black bars up top instead, so it looks a little less annoying (if you\u2019re the kind of person that doesn\u2019t like how the cutouts look).</p>",
            "<p>And if you look at the phone\u2019s top edge, Huawei even included a built-in IR blaster for controlling your TV, which use to be a mainstay of many flagship phones, but has become a rarity nowadays. As for the guts, those aren\u2019t half bad either, with the P20 sporting Huawei\u2019s own Kirin 970 CPU, 4GB or 6GB of RAM (depending on the model) and 128GB of storage standard. </p>",
            "<p>That said, the one quirk I\u2019m still not sold on is the P20's front fingerprint sensor. I feel like if  a company is going through the trouble of adding notches to increase screen real estate, it might as well go all the way and put the fingerprint reader on the back too. However, it seems Huawei doesn\u2019t quite agree, as senior director of product marketing Steve Lai told me the front fingerprint reader is a hereditary nod to P-series phones of previous years.</p>",
            "<p>Aside from having one less camera in the back, the main difference the standard and pro models is that the basic version features a 5.8-inch LCD displays and a smaller 3400 mAh battery versus the P20 Pro\u2019s 6.1-inch OLD screen and massive 4,000 battery pack. </p>",
            "<p>But now comes the sad part. As exciting and audacious as the P20 sounds, especially that camera packed pro model, Huawei has no plans to bring it to the US. On one hand, you could say that\u2019s just business as normal for Huawei, who has never officially sold a P-series phone over here. But then again, if Huawei hadn\u2019t <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/best-buy-plans-to-stop-selling-huawei-devices-as-new-co-1823980180\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/best-buy-plans-to-stop-selling-huawei-devices-as-new-co-1823980180', {metric25:1})\">run into so many issues getting its phones into retail stores</a> earlier this year, maybe the P20 would have been the first. Either way, it means us here in the States are going to miss out on what might be the coolest phone of the year. </p>"

And unlike phones from Samsung or Huawei, the Pixel 3 achieved this not by hitting users over the head with tons of cameras or far-out hardware; it did it in the most Google way possible: With nifty software, intuitive design, and AI-powered smarts.<br></p>",
            "<p>But at the same time, the Pixel 3 is also one of the most frustrating phones of the year, because, for all of its upgrades and additions, it\u2019s not difficult to see a number of small tweaks that would have made it so much better. And if you step back and look past the Pixel 3 itself, there are a lot of issues that show Google still has a long way to go before it can truly call itself a world-class phone maker.</p>",
            "<p>If you just look at the Pixel 3's specs, its price doesn\u2019t make any sense. Sure, you get a Snapdragon 845 processor, which is the same chip found in every other flagship Android phone. But both the standard $700 Pixel and the $750 Pixel 3 XL\u2014which have already been discounted $100 to $250 in the three months since its launch\u2014only get 4GB of RAM.</p>",

That\u2019s an extra 64GB of room for stashing pictures, apps, videos, and anything else you save on your phone, while that extra RAM lets you keep multiple apps (games especially) suspended in the background, so you aren\u2019t constantly forced to reload them into memory.</p>",
            "<p>What happened to the ethos of old Nexus phones that paired stock Android to well-built devices with reasonable price tags? With the cost of flagship phones hitting new highs every year, a really good $500 phone has never been more important, and yet, it\u2019s a sector that so many companies are just ceding to OnePlus and other Chinese phone makers.</p>",
            "<p>Then there\u2019s the Pixel 3's\u00a05.5-inch 2160 x 1080 OLED screen. Compared to the 5.8-inch 2960 x 1440 display on the Galaxy S9, Samsung\u2019s screen not only offers a higher pixel density, but it\u2019s brighter and more vibrant as well. On top of that, like the iPhone, the Pixel 3 doesn\u2019t have expandable storage or a headphone jack. So what are you paying for? Some black paint inside the USB-C port, wireless charging (a feature that should have been on last year\u2019s Pixel 2), and a fancy soft-touch micro-etched glass back? The math just doesn\u2019t add up.</p>",
            "<p>But what\u2019s annoying is that as amazing as Google\u2019s computational photography and HDR+ mode are, the Pixel 3 could be an even better picture taker if Google truly embraced the dual camera trend. It\u2019s maddening because Google\u2019s use of dual front-facing cams on the Pixel 3 for capturing super wide angle selfies demonstrates that the company is aware of the potential benefits of multiple cameras. And yet, on the back of the Pixel 3, one cam is all you get.</p>",

Just think how good the Pixel 3's long-distance photos could be if Google implemented Super Res Zoom on a camera with an optical 2x zoom lens.

It\u2019s nearly two full rows of notifications tall, and even with that big bucktooth hanging down, the Pixel 3 XL still has an unusually large chin. WTF. You can have a notch <em>or</em> a chin, not both.</p>",
            "<p>All these inscrutable hardware decisions sort of hit on one overarching theme: That Google doesn\u2019t really give a shit about hardware, at least not in the same way other gadget makers do. For a flagship, it feels like Google did the bare minimum needed to assemble the Pixel 3, and then relied on its software prowess to carry the phone the rest of the way. It\u2019s not just the Pixel 3, just look across Google\u2019s entire range of products, and in most cases, the company goes out of its way to avoid talking about specs or components.</p>",
            "<p>Instead, Google focuses on things like designs with bright, friendly colors and textured fabrics that fit in with modern living. It feels like Google hopes its devices will appear simple and innocuous like a light switch on a wall, which makes sense from an ease-of-use standpoint and for devices like the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/its-hard-not-to-love-the-google-home-mini-1819341054\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/its-hard-not-to-love-the-google-home-mini-1819341054', {metric25:1})\">Home Mini.</a> But if Google is really going to challenge Apple and Samsung, it needs to care more about hardware too.</p>",
            "<p>As for the Pixel 3's software, the company is doing amazing things to help combat robocalls with its built-in Call Screener, and streamline your life by letting the Google Assistant book your appointments.

            "<p>Nothing ruins a new smartphone more than critical features like messaging or the camera not working, and as a reviewer, it\u2019s frustrating to see people suffer from issues you didn\u2019t experience while testing, especially when the only advice you can give is to say that \u201cGoogle is working on patching the issue soon.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s a similar issue for features like <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2018/11/28/comment-google-pixel-launch-buy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://9to5google.com/2018/11/28/comment-google-pixel-launch-buy/', {metric25:1})\">Night Sight</a> and <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/i-broke-google-duplex-but-its-still-impressive-1827131546\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/i-broke-google-duplex-but-its-still-impressive-1827131546', {metric25:1})\">Google Duplex</a>, because as good as they are, if you tease them at your launch event, they probably ought to be available when the phone first goes on sale. Is DLC something we need to worry about on phones now too?</p>",
            "<p>There are also other notable concerns like Google\u2019s ramshackle quality control. For the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/google-is-investigating-an-issue-with-the-pixel-2-xl-s-1819765192\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/google-is-investigating-an-issue-with-the-pixel-2-xl-s-1819765192', {metric25:1})\">second year in a row</a>, Gizmodo got review devices featuring screens with markedly different color temperatures. And when I asked for comment on the issue, Google said some variances in manufacturing sometimes results in minor difference. But the thing is, iPhones and Galaxys don\u2019t suffer from these kinds of issues, the Pixel shouldn\u2019t either.</p>",
            "<p>Ben Schoon over at 9to5Google recently made a case that between all of the bugs and issues new Pixel owners tend to experience at launch\u2014and all the price reductions that follow shortly after\u2014<a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2018/11/28/comment-google-pixel-launch-buy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://9to5google.com/2018/11/28/comment-google-pixel-launch-buy/', {metric25:1})\">that no one should buy a Pixel at launch ever again</a>. And while I won\u2019t go that far (Google has one more chance to get it right), early Pixel adopters do seem to be treated more like beta testers more than buyers of any other phone.</p>",
            "<p>And when it comes to the way Google collects data from your phone, there\u2019s unrest brewing. On the one hand, a lot of very handy features like traffic alerts for your daily commute, restaurants suggestions, and f<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/googles-feature-for-predicting-flight-delays-actually-s-1831148930\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/googles-feature-for-predicting-flight-delays-actually-s-1831148930', {metric25:1})\">light delay predictions</a> are things that can only work if Google knows some pretty intimate details about you. But at the same time, concerns about privacy and data security are becoming more prevalent, and issues like <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.apnews.com/828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb', {metric25:1})\">Android tracking</a> you even when you specifically turn the feature off isn\u2019t helping anyone feel better about our new super-connected world.</p>",
            "<p>Lastly, Google\u2019s partnership with Verizon as the \u201cexclusive\u201d retailer of the Pixel is bullshit. Yes, you can buy an unlocked Pixel 3 direct from Google and take it to pretty much any carrier you want, but if Google wants to compete with Apple and Samsung, the Pixel needs to be available in every carrier store, regardless of what name is on the sign outside.</p>",
            "<p>I still believe the Pixel 3 is the best phone for most people. But the gap between the Pixel 3 and other phones isn\u2019t nearly as wide as it could have been. And after three years, while Google was finally able to put all the pieces together properly in creating the Pixel 3, until Google can offer the kind of quality control, stability, and value you get from iPhones and Galaxys, the Pixel may be forced to live in their shadows.</p>",

            "<p>As the fall smartphone season starts to wind down, the number two smartphone maker in the world (<a href=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/huawei-surpasses-apple/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.counterpointresearch.com/huawei-surpasses-apple/', {metric25:1})\">it\u2019s not Apple anymore</a>) is  sending us off with its answer to this year\u2019s batch of iPhones, Pixels, and Galaxies with the Huawei Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro.<br></p>",
            "<p>From the outside, The Mate 10\u2019s specs and features  put it on the same level as other flagship phones thanks to components including built-in fingerprint readers, dual rear cameras, slick glass bodies with minimal bezels, IP67 water-resistance and massive 4,000 mAh batteries, which are some of  biggest power packs you\u2019ll find in any phone that costs over $600.</p>",
            "<p>But Huawei wants to take things even further by harnessing the power in the Mate 10's new Kirin 970 chip, which the Huawei says has transformed the Mate 10 from  a boring old smartphone and into full on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HuaweiMobile/status/913684195574255617\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://twitter.com/HuaweiMobile/status/913684195574255617', {metric25:1})\">intelligent machine</a>. But wtf does that mean? </p>",
            "<p>Anyone who watched <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YGoxbeSzLc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YGoxbeSzLc', {metric25:1})\">Google\u2019s Pixel 2 announcement</a> saw Google CEO Sundar Pichai spend the first 10 minutes of the presentation talking about the importance of AI and machine learning, and its a trend Huawei has been trying to incorporate into its phones too. Huawei\u2019s first attempt was on the Mate 9, which Huawei says uses algorithms to help the phone maintain its performance and battery efficiency over time. But the Kirin 970 looks to take Huawei\u2019s dreams of machine learning  even further thanks to the chip\u2019s new neural network processing unit (NPU), which the company says should offer 20 percent better performance when it comes to AI-related tasks, enhanced memory and storage optimization and super fast object recognition.</p>",
            "<p>Apparently, that last one is a biggie, because its the most notable way Huawei has attempted to smarten up its phone. By leveraging NPU\u2019s ability to quickly identify various objects, the camera can automatically enable the correct mode for scenes including, text, food, snow, plants, portraits, dogs, cats and more. That could mean less time fiddling around with settings like shutter speed and ISO, and more time concentrating on nailing the shot, which can be a big deal when you\u2019re hoping to grab a shot of a pet or baby.</p>",
            "<p>When I got a chance to try it for myself, it worked quite well. All I had to do was point the camera at something, and before I knew it, a little icon popped up in the camera app letting me know the NPU\u2019s object identification algorithm was working. And while it doesn\u2019t work on every object just yet, Huawei says it will push updates to the phone so that it can identify more categories down the road. Huawei even partnered with Microsoft on a special translation app that, once again, uses the NPU so that you can translate text simply by taking a picture of it. </p>",
            "<p> New software isn\u2019t the only thing that has improved on the Mate 10\u2019s cameras, as these are also the first phones featuring f/1.6 apertures on both its 12-megapixel main camera and its secondary 20-MP monochrome sensor. But I\u2019m still wondering if automatic scene switching and translation that still isn\u2019t in real-time actually warrants calling this phone an intelligent machine. </p>",
            "<p>Maybe the real genius is Huawei\u2019s decision to make third-party support for its NPU as simple as possible, so that other companies can create new machine learning apps using open-source platforms such as Tensor Flow Lite and Caffe 2. That way, when someone figures how to really leverage AI and machine learning, the Mate 10 won\u2019t get left behind. </p>",
            "<p>Something that isn\u2019t super smart, are the varying specs between the standard Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro. While I get why Huawei\u2019s upgraded the Pro with a 6-inch screen  18:9 OLED display, its resolution tops out at 1920 x 1080, which is lower than the 2560 x 1440 5.9-inch 16:9  LCD display you get on the standard Mate 10. On top of that, the base model also has a headphone jack, something the Pro doesn\u2019t receive. If you\u2019re going to make a premium model and slap a pro tag on it, it should have all the features of the standard model and more, not less.</p>",
            "<p>While Huawei has yet to announce official U.S. pricing and availability, the company did confirm that the Mate 10 will make it stateside eventually. When it does, I hope there are even more new tricks built into the phone, because from what I\u2019ve seen, the Mate 10 seems like another big, powerful, and potentially long-lasting phone from Huawei, but not necessarily that much smarter than its competition. </p>"

            "<p>As the only mainstream phone maker that hasn\u2019t adopted the notch, Samsung\u2019s recent handsets show it\u2019s possible to ignore trends and still look good. The top bezel on the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944', {metric25:1})\">Galaxy S9</a> is especially impressive as Samsung crams a selfie cam, ambient light sensor, dual iris sensors, proximity sensor, LED indicator, and an earpiece-speaker combo into less than 7mm of space. And while the S9\u2019s blank bezel below the display isn\u2019t quite as feature rich, it creates a nicely balanced aesthetic without the ridiculous excess of previous fat bezel phones. However, as sleek as Samsung\u2019s design is, bezels have got to go.</p>",
            "<p>OK, technically the Xiaomi wasn\u2019t the first company to toy with a phone featuring no bezels on three sides of the device, that honor goes to the original <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/sharp-aquos-crystal-hands-on-no-bezel-all-beauty-1624111177\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/sharp-aquos-crystal-hands-on-no-bezel-all-beauty-1624111177', {metric25:1})\">Sharp Aquos Crystal</a> from way back in 2014(!). But for the Mi Mix and Mi Mix 2, Xiaomi took that concept and improved on it significantly increasing the phones\u2019 screen-to-body ratio and using clever tricks like piezoelectric speakers to make the earpiece disappear. Now there\u2019s still a bit of awkwardness since you need to flip the phone upside down to take a selfie, but those are just the sort of (temporary) sacrifices that get made when chasing an all screen experience.</p>",
            "<p>Here we are, the phone that transformed the notch from a design statement to a way of life. That\u2019s because inside that cutout, on top of your normal sensors and cameras, the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/i-hate-how-much-i-love-the-iphone-x-1820086867\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/i-hate-how-much-i-love-the-iphone-x-1820086867', {metric25:1})\">iPhone X</a> and <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-xs-is-forever-1829305262\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-xs-is-forever-1829305262', {metric25:1})\">XS</a> sport infrared 3D dot projectors so you can unlock the phone with your face. It\u2019s cool, it\u2019s neat, and one of the few \u201cinnovations\u201d that Apple actually managed to do first. And for that luxury, Apple raised the price of flagship phones to $1,000. But what\u2019s even funnier about all this, is that Apple\u2019s switch to Face ID may be the reason why future iPhones will still feature notches long after every other phone maker has jumped ship.</p>",
            "<p>As we sit here at the end of 2018, notches have become pretty commonplace. And just when you think things had gotten to point where they couldn\u2019t annoy you any more, Google went a put this massive bathtub-sized cut out on the top of the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/google-pixel-3-review-the-other-way-to-make-a-killer-p-1829749807\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/google-pixel-3-review-the-other-way-to-make-a-killer-p-1829749807', {metric25:1})\">Pixel 3 XL</a>. Look, I know XL stands for extra large, but perhaps Google didn\u2019t need to take things so literally. That cutout takes up nearly two lines of notification icons, and considering the Pixel 3 XL also has a pretty sizable chin below its screen, it\u2019s really a wonder why its notch needed to be that big.</p>",
            "<p>This category is for all the phones at came in the iPhone X\u2019s wake. Many of the notches on devices like the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-triple-camera-p20-pro-is-too-cool-for-america-1825647834\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-triple-camera-p20-pro-is-too-cool-for-america-1825647834', {metric25:1})\">Huawei P20 Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/asus-basically-made-a-more-affordable-iphone-x-ripoff-w-1823352258\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/asus-basically-made-a-more-affordable-iphone-x-ripoff-w-1823352258', {metric25:1})\">Asus Zenfone 5</a>, <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/lgs-g7-thinq-is-too-clever-for-its-own-good-1825818482#_ga=2.149250550.1140511872.1539954186-1220318864.1537376527\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/lgs-g7-thinq-is-too-clever-for-its-own-good-1825818482#_ga=2.149250550.1140511872.1539954186-1220318864.1537376527', {metric25:1})\">LG G7</a>, and others are smaller and more compact than Apple\u2019s cutout, except not quite as functional and even less memorable. This marks the point when the notch transitioned from a novel idea to simply a means to an end\u2014a way to offer a little more display but without any other radical changes.</p>",
            "<p>Here it is, the original, the forefather, the PH-1, or more simply, <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-essential-phone-is-too-expensive-to-have-a-camera-t-1798408448\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-essential-phone-is-too-expensive-to-have-a-camera-t-1798408448', {metric25:1})\">the Essential Phone</a>. This is the device that got the whole notch movement started, and in a somewhat perverse timeline of events, it was one of the least obtrusive cutouts among notched devices until the arrival of the phones below. It was simple and it only had one job to do: provide a place for the front-facing camera to live. And when you consider the rest of Essential\u2019s lovingly minimalist design, the PH-1\u2019s notch was something that made the phone more appealing, not less, which was a lesson that many of Essential\u2019s followers never really captured.</p>",
            "<p>More than a year after the PH-1, this is what the Essential notch has become: a slightly curvier but similarly-sized cut. It\u2019s as iterative as iterative gets and it while the teardrop-shaped cutout on the <a href=\"https://www.vivo.com/my/products/v11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.vivo.com/my/products/v11', {metric25:1})\">Vivo V11 </a>and <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_r17_pro-9288.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_r17_pro-9288.php', {metric25:1})\">Oppo R17</a> might help you tell your phone apart from the multitude of other notched devices, with phones like the Huawei Mate 20 coming soon, it\u2019s probably already too late. The teardrop is merely a stepping stone, a bit of pithy self-expression, but not the end goal. That full-screen promised land is within sight, but that last little cutout isn\u2019t gone quite yet.</p>",
            "<p>Finally, we\u2019ve arrived. The <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/this-gorgeous-all-screen-phone-shows-how-the-notch-dies-1829737051\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/this-gorgeous-all-screen-phone-shows-how-the-notch-dies-1829737051', {metric25:1})\">Oppo Find X</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.vivo.com/in/products/nex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.vivo.com/in/products/nex', {metric25:1})\">Vivo Nex</a> have made the all-screen dream a reality. One phone has an entire section that rises up to reveal a selfie shooter, while the other features a much smaller popup housing that looks more like a flash on an old-school camera than a selfie cam. But the results are the same. There\u2019s no cutouts or other distractions to take away from the display, which means you can fully utilize the phone\u2019s screen real estate for watching movies, playing games, or doing anything else you want. And yet, as finished consumer-ready devices, both of these phones are flawed and aren\u2019t really available outside of Asia. But as examples for the other extreme of the notched phone spectrum, it\u2019s mission accomplished.<br></p>",
            "<p>From here on out, everything will just be slight variations on this until something more revolutionary comes around, which may not be too long if Samsung lives up to its promises of debuting a bendy-screen handset before the end of the year. But still, here\u2019s the evolutionary path of the notch from start to finish. What a wild ride it\u2019s been.</p>"

        "text": [
            "<p>For the last few years, $600, $650, or maybe even $700 was all you needed to get a brand new top-of-the\u2014line phone. But in 2018, a lot of people are going to tasked with a difficult choice: shell out another $200 or $300 to hit the increased price tags flagships are now demanding, or settle for something a bit more affordable. And at first, this proposition might sound like <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-fans-better-prepare-for-a-ridiculously-expensiv-1822764696\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-fans-better-prepare-for-a-ridiculously-expensiv-1822764696', {metric25:1})\">another frustrating aspect of an increasingly crazy product cycle</a>, but it doesn\u2019t actually have to be that way. That\u2019s because there are mid-range phones like the $500 <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-oneplus-5t-is-very-a-damn-good-phone-for-a-reasonab-1820596179\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-oneplus-5t-is-very-a-damn-good-phone-for-a-reasonab-1820596179', {metric25:1})\">OnePlus 5T</a> and this new Honor View 10, that can make that second option feel less like a compromise and more like a good way to stop getting screwed.</p>",
            "<p>A quick glance down the spec list reveals that all the most important stuff is there: from the View 10\u2019s extra-tall 5.99-inch 18:9 LCD display, to the built-in front-mounted fingerprint reader, sturdy aluminum build, and  the handy headphone jack down below. Even the amount of memory and storage you get are quite impressive, as the View 10 comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage standard, with the latter being double what you\u2019d get on a standard <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-oneplus-5t-is-very-a-damn-good-phone-for-a-reasonab-1820596179\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-oneplus-5t-is-very-a-damn-good-phone-for-a-reasonab-1820596179', {metric25:1})\">OnePlus 5T</a> or the pricey $900 <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-note-8-review-bigger-badder-but-i-sti-1799759566\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-note-8-review-bigger-badder-but-i-sti-1799759566', {metric25:1})\">Galaxy Note 8</a>. And in case you still need more room for apps and photos, the second slot in the dual SIM tray supports microSD cards too.</p>",
            "<p>In fact, the View 10\u2019s biggest flaws are minor omissions, like its lack of wireless charging and water-resistance, and the unfortunate limitation of not having CMDA network compatibility, which means this phone isn\u2019t an option for people on Verizon or Sprint. The other really frustrating thing is that despite being announced at the end of 2017, we\u2019re still waiting on official US pricing and availability. It almost certainly has nothing to do with the espionage concerns leveled at Honor\u2019s parent company <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/tag/huawei\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/tag/huawei', {metric25:1})\">Huawei</a>. Huawei has <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/report-verizon-dumps-huawei-phones-as-us-government-pr-1822545973\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/report-verizon-dumps-huawei-phones-as-us-government-pr-1822545973', {metric25:1})\">run into major difficulties</a> when trying to partner with US carriers to sell its latest flagship, but  Honor has always relied on direct-to-consumer sales.</p>",
            "<p>My only other quibble with the View 10 is the way Huawei\u2019s EMUI 8 skin looks. It\u2019s one of the most radical departures from stock Android available today, with its rounded notifications cards, lack of an app drawer and iOS-style Share menus. Thankfully, all these things can be customized in the phone\u2019s settings, including the overall look and feel of the UI via the Theme app. I just wish I didn\u2019t have to spend so much time fiddling with everything out of the box. </p>",
            "<p>Then there are other things like Honor\u2019s claim of enhanced AI that are meant to improve how the phone functions. It\u2019s a feature borrowed straight from Huawei\u2019s latest flagship, the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-10-pro-is-a-valiant-attempt-to-slay-the-ip-1820480251\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-10-pro-is-a-valiant-attempt-to-slay-the-ip-1820480251', {metric25:1})\">Mate 10 Pro.</a> However, in real life, the effects of the phone\u2019s extra smarts are often quite hard to discern. Honor claims that machine learning algorithms will automatically tune your phone for better battery life and make sure performance still feels snappy a year or more down the road, but it never does so in a way where you notice it happening, which often leaves you wondering if it\u2019s <em>actually</em> happening.</p>",
            "<p>The two exceptions to this is a custom version of Microsoft\u2019s Translator app, which uses the Honor 10\u2019s Kirin 970\u2019s neural processing unit to deliver on-the-fly exchanges using either, written, spoken or even text captured in a picture. In my short time I spent testing it by spitting admittedly poorly pronounced Chinese at the Honor 10, it almost always came back with the correct response. However, once again, when compared side-by-side with other big translating apps from Google and others, it was hard to tell how much heavy lifting the View 10\u2019s AI was really doing. </p>",
            "<p>On the other hand, the View 10\u2019s AI-enhanced camera makes it easy to tell when the phone\u2019s silicon smarts are helping. Using image recognition, the phone can identify a handful of different subjects like cats, dogs, plants, food and more. And when it does, it\u2019ll pop up a little corresponding icon in the bottom of the phone\u2019s camera UI, while using that knowledge to automatically adjust camera settings to get the best pic possible. When it works, it really does feel a bit like magic. In a side-by-side shot between the View 10 and the OnePlus 5T, after correctly determining I was taking a photo of a plant, or what\u2019s better know as my lazy attempt to use tech to grow basil indoors, the View 10 produced a shot with better white balance and  more detail in the shadows for a more pleasing image overall. It\u2019s not a night and day improvement, but it is noticeable.<br></p>",
            "<p>But when not assisted by AI smarts, I found colors from the View 10 were often more muted than those from the OP5T. And in low-light, things weren\u2019t even close, as evidence by a dimly shot of everyone\u2019s favorite cuddly sci-fi birds in the slideshow below. Though, to be honest, that\u2019s not entirely unexpected as the OnePlus\u2019 secondary camera was designed specifically to improve low-light photography. The View 10 tries to counters with a second rear cam of its own that sports a 2x zoom lens, similar to what you\u2019d get on the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/i-hate-how-much-i-love-the-iphone-x-1820086867\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/i-hate-how-much-i-love-the-iphone-x-1820086867', {metric25:1})\">iPhone X</a> or <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-note-8-review-bigger-badder-but-i-sti-1799759566\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-note-8-review-bigger-badder-but-i-sti-1799759566', {metric25:1})\">Galaxy Note 8</a>. It\u2019s not anything I\u2019d call essential, but it does give you a little more creative freedom when it comes to shooting stuff far away.<br></p>",
            "<p>Honor even caps everything off with a relatively large 3,750 mAh battery, which did a fine job in our rundown test as it kept the View 10 going for just over 10 hours (10:04 to be exact). That time compares pretty favorably to results from the Note 8 (10:13) and the iPhone x (9:56), though it\u2019s still an hour short of the Pixel 2 XL (11:17), OP5T (11:22), and its more expensive sibling, the Mate 10 Pro (11:13), which were three of the longest lasting phones I tested last year. <br></p>",
            "<p>Is the Honor View 10 as sleek or tech-laden as the Galaxy Note 8 or iPhone X? No, and it\u2019s not really that close. But as those phones continue to push the price of flagship devices even higher, they are also leaving a lot of people simply looking for a good device behind. And the Honor View 10 is just that, a solid phone with good specs, tons of storage, and some nice bonuses such as dual rear cams, a headphone jack and a bit a AI smarts. Now here\u2019s hoping Honor stops sandbagging its US release, so that people can have even another good option for resisting the rise of the super premium smartphone. Not everyone wants a OnePlus 5T.</p>",
