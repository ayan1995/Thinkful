            "<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>The Google Pixel 3 is still one of the best phones around, with not much in the way of new competition since launch. But it's still just as expensive as it was at launch too, so we've added a comparison to the cheaper OnePlus 6T.</em></p>",
            "<p>The Google Pixel 3 has the best smartphone camera you can buy today, and yet it comes in a one-hand-friendly size with a large enough screen to satisfy most people.</p>",
            "<p>You don\u2019t need a big, pocket-busting phone to get great photos (this one has a 5.5-inch screen), nor do you need a dual-lens rear camera (it has a single lens on back), nor the fastest aperture on a phone (f/1.8 has been beaten by the LG and Samsung\u2019s speedier f/1.5 aperture). Google proves that its 12.2MP photos are better because of machine-learning camera software and consistency.</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 3 \u2013 and larger Pixel 3 XL \u2013 makes lugging around a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/best-compact-camera\">compact camera</a> or even an <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/best-entry-level-dslr-camera\">entry-level DSLR</a> redundant. It also has features you can't get on professional cameras, unless you're constantly changing lenses. There are two front-facing 8MP cameras here, with the second lens designed for wide-angle selfies, enabling you to get groups photos without cutting people out of the picture.</p>",
            "<p>To this day, the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-pixel-2-review\">Google Pixel 2</a> camera still amazes us, and the Pixel 3 builds off of that success with better photo detail and enhanced HDR. What\u2019s more, the color-rich OLED screen is far superior due to its 18:9 aspect ratio. It\u2019s not bezel-less by any means, but you do get more screen real estate than on the Pixel 2 \u2013 and keep the front-facing stereo speakers. It also avoids Pixel 3 XL\u2019s awkward notch cut out that so many people hate on.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019re not going to get <em>everything</em> in this small package. The battery falls short of bigger phones at a 2,915mAh capacity, offering all-day battery life with conservative use in our tests. Snapping 100 great photos in two hours was a real battery life drain. You\u2019re also stuck with 64GB or 128GB \u2013 there\u2019s no microSD card slot, and there\u2019s no headphone jack. And, as much as we laud the behind-the-scenes camera software, the app doesn\u2019t have all of Samsung's and LG's neat camera app tricks.</p>",
            "<p>The Google Pixel 3 is the ideal smartphone for anyone who cares about photo quality and isn\u2019t satisfied with their phone\u2019s picture-taking abilities today. It has the camera smarts and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/android-pie-9-features-release-date-and-phones-list\"><u>Android Pie</u></a>-powered AI smarts of the Pixel 3 XL, without the awkward notch cut-out at the top. And, unlike the comparable, one-hand-friendly <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-xs-review\">iPhone XS</a>, it\u2019s cheap \u2013 at least by 2018 flagship standards.</p>",
            "<p><em>Watch our first impressions of the Google Pixel 3 in video form below...</em></p>",
            "<p>The Google Pixel 3 landed on October 18 in the US, and November 1 in the UK and Australia. Availability is also slated for Canada, France, Germany, Japan, India, Ireland, Italy, Singapore, Spain, and Taiwan. Pre-orders began right after the October 9 launch event.</p>",

            "<p>The Pixel 3 price is $799 (\u00a3739, AU$1,199) for the 64GB version, and $899 (\u00a3839, AU$1,349) for the 128GB version. We recommend more internal storage since you can\u2019t upgrade later (there\u2019s no microSD card slot on this phone).</p>",
            "<p>On contract in the US, it's exclusive to Verizon, starting at $33.33 a month for 64GB or $37.49 a month for 128GB for the duration of 24 months. Sadly, you won't find it sold at AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Sprint, or other US carriers, but you can get the unlocked Google Pixel 3 at full price from official Google's store.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s a price hike from the Google Pixel 2 (by $150), yet cheaper than an iPhone XS (by $200). You're paying for the more expansive screen and machine-learning camera, and the fact that almost all flagship smartphones cost more in 2018.</p>",
            "<p class=\"mid__article\"></p>",
            "<p class=\"bordeaux-image-check\"><img src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\" lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image\" onerror=\"this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" sizes=\"auto\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cJ7KwbqcggTkoCUthNKkad-320-80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cJ7KwbqcggTkoCUthNKkad-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cJ7KwbqcggTkoCUthNKkad-650-80.jpg 650w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cJ7KwbqcggTkoCUthNKkad.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cJ7KwbqcggTkoCUthNKkad.jpg\"></p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 3 retains Google's familiar two-tone design \u2013 the back has shiny glass at the top, while lower 80% has a matte finish. There's a more seamless transition between the two textures for a higher-quality look and feel, but overall its look hasn't changed dramatically.</p>",
            "<p>It easily fits in one hand, and, for the most part, you can operate it without resorting to using two hands. That's the best reason to choose the Pixel 3 over the Pixel 3 XL. It's screen size is big enough, yet the phone handfeel is rather manageable. That and it doesn't have an ugly notch cut out at the top, a design choice that a deal breaker for many.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 3 series looks similar to last year's phones, but it does in fact use different materials. The entire back is made of soft-touch glass using Corning Gorilla Glass 5. It's the same strengthened glass that protects the front screen, and it's all sandwiching an aluminum frame that has a hybrid coating \u2013 that's the only bit of metal you'll find on the outside.</p>",
            "<p class=\"bordeaux-image-check\"><img src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\" lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image\" onerror=\"this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" sizes=\"auto\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5bvi4a2qPYyrN6iM4n9JmW-320-80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5bvi4a2qPYyrN6iM4n9JmW-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5bvi4a2qPYyrN6iM4n9JmW-650-80.jpg 650w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5bvi4a2qPYyrN6iM4n9JmW.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5bvi4a2qPYyrN6iM4n9JmW.jpg\"></p>",
            "<p>Sure, the all-glass design makes the Pixel 3 more susceptible to damage (though we have yet to find the scratches others have reported), but glass also enables a better LTE connection and wireless charging. That's why we've seen a lack of aluminum-backed flagship phones in 2018. The Pixel 3 is the latest causality.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>Wireless charging is a new feature for the Pixel phones, and a welcome change now that Google has launched the Pixel Stand wireless charger alongside its new devices. We haven't had a wirelessly charging Google phone since the plastic <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/google-nexus-6-1271190/review\">Nexus 6</a>.</p>",
            "<p>More rounded edges are everywhere on the Pixel 3. Its frame is less boxy than previous Google phones, a trend we've seen from the iPhone and and others. Gone is the harsher silver bevel around the frame and rear fingerprint sensor. It's like Google put the Pixel 2 through a smoothing machine, and we like the results.</p>",
            "<p>You'll still find dual front-facing speakers on the Google Pixel 3. No one else is really doing this anymore (except Razer with the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/hands-on-razer-phone-2\">Razer Phone 2</a>), so it's nice to see in a flagship device. You'll also get Active Edge, which allows you to squeeze the sides of the phone to call up Google Assistant. We much prefer this squeeze mechanic as opposed to a dedicated AI button on the frame, like Samsung does with Bixby button (which we often confuse for the volume down button).</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 3 comes with USB-C earbuds in the box, which means, no, there's no standard 3.5mm headphone jack (just like last year's Pixel 2) and without that microSD card slot, you're stuck with 64GB and 128GB storage configurations.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 3 color are rather muted, with 'Just Black' as our favorite of the trio. 'Clearly White' looks cheaper and 'Not Pink' isn't for everyone. Okay, it's the color you want if you're looking to stand out a bit, but we liked last year's unique Mint color more. You do get a fresh Mint color on the Clearly White Google Pixel 3 power button, however.</p>",
            "<p>The 5.5-inch OLED screen fits into modern times. It's big and expansive, and sits in a phone that's smaller than we had expected given the screen size rumors. The entire thing measures 145.6 x 68.2 x 7.9mm and weighs 148g. It's roughly the same size as the Pixel 2, which had a smaller 5-inch display.</p>",
            "<p>It's the grown up version of last year's phone. The Pixel 3 screen looks richer than last year's Pixel 2, too. The specs note that it has only a few more pixels per inch, but keep in mind the screen is much taller, so there are a lot more pixels spread across a half inch of extra screen. There's noticeably less bezel thanks to it's 18:9 aspect ratio rather than the dated 16:9 look. Last year's oversized bezel, we felt, was the biggest disappointment design-wise about the Pixel 2XL. The Google Pixel 3 fixes this issue.</p>",
            "<p>Oh, it still has bezel. There's no hiding the two front-facing cameras and speaker at the top and chin at the bottom. But it's the best we've seen from a phone with dual front-facing speakers and without a deep (some would say ugly) notch cut out.</p>"

            "<p>The Google Pixel 3 has the best smartphone camera in the world. It's not because the photos it takes are dramatically better \u2014 but they're just marginally better.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>The bigger deal is that Google's 12.2MP camera is more consistent. We got more detailed, sharper, and slightly brighter photos from this Pixel 3 camera than the warmer iPhone XS and the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 cameras. There's less noise than the Pixel 2 and everything wasn't over-sharpened like the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/huawei-p20-pro-review\">Huawei P20 Pro</a> camera.</p>",
            "<p class=\"bordeaux-image-check\"><img src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\" lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image\" onerror=\"this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" sizes=\"auto\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KC3b5wyzm6PQQqVZypNBZd-320-80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KC3b5wyzm6PQQqVZypNBZd-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KC3b5wyzm6PQQqVZypNBZd-650-80.jpg 650w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KC3b5wyzm6PQQqVZypNBZd.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KC3b5wyzm6PQQqVZypNBZd.jpg\"></p>",
            "<p>A lot of this has to do with what's happening behind the scenes. The f/1.8 aperture isn't record-breaking, but Google's camera-dedicated Pixel Visual Core chip and its machine-learning software help deliver this single-lens rear camera its wow factor.</p>",
            "<p class=\"mid__article\"></p>",
            "<p>New software perks like Top Shot help avoid closed eyes by picking the right photo, while Night Sight (coming soon) will give the Google Pixel 3 the edge in most nighttime pictures. It's already doing a fine job (for a smartphone camera) in low-light, according to our tests.</p>",
            "<p>Super Res Zoom helps mitigate the fact that there's no telephoto lens here, with the ability to use backend software to improve digitally zoom The fact that the camera captures larger 1.4 micron pixels and has optical image stabilization (OIS) is also a difference maker.</p>",
            "<p>The same general photo consistency comes to the front-facing 8MP cameras. They reliably took photos with better HDR and less noise. One camera had a normal 75 degree field of view and the other has a wider 97 degree field of view.</p>",
            "<p>The wide-angle selfies are effective at telling more about who you're with and what you're posing in front of, so much so that Google refers to this secondary lens as it's Group Selfie Camera.</p>",
            "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/lg-v10-1305854/review\"><u>LG V10</u></a> introduced us to this wide selfie camera idea, and the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lg-v40-thinq\"><u>LG V40</u></a> continues the trend. Google\u2019s wide-angle photos are better, though they do have some caveats.\u00a0The aperture is f/2.2 using this lens (vs f1.8 on the normal lens) but you won't notice a big difference in good lighting. The bigger caveat to the Group Selfie Camera is barrel distortion around the edges.</p>",
            "<p>Holding the phone just right helps capture more of what's around you, whether you're posing in front of a tall building or taking a crowded selfie. We posed in front of a distant Hollywood sign, and got an LA-emblazoned T-Shirt in the photo. With any normal selfie camera, the T-Shirt or the Hollywood sign would be cut out.</p>",
            "<p>Here's the problem: Holding in the wrong way takes unflattering photos that make you look like you've been through a funhouse mirror. You may be able to capture more of what's above you, but when more of your shirt fans out, you look like you've put on some awkward weight. Holding the phone out further or at a different angle usually helps. Taking selfies is a skill. Taking wide selfies will earn you another millennial merit badge.</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 3 shoots impressive 4K video with a mix of optical image stabilization (OIS) and electronic software stabilization. Everything looks incredibly smooth, making the need for something like the DJI Osmo 2 gimbal less of a necessity. You won't, however, find the 4K to shoot 60 frames per second. Google has capped video at this max resolution at 30fps.</p>"

            "<p>The Pixel 3 has a 2,915mAh battery, which is slightly smaller than we had hoped (the Samsung Galaxy S9 has a 3,000mAh and we think that could stand to last longer), but it's still an improvement over last year's 5-inch Pixel, which had a 2,700mAh unit.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>The battery life is the biggest downside to opting for the smaller Pixel 3. Yes, you can get all-day battery life from this phone with conservative use, but even normal use had us reaching for the charger before the end of the night. That's a problem when you're capturing so many photos using the great camera. The battery really takes a hit.\u00a0</p>",

            "<p>Google's new Android 9 Pie software does give it more juice, with adaptive battery settings that work behind the scenes. It essentially limits the power of apps you don't use in the course of a day, and it's a perk that\u2019s coming to all Android Pie phones (you may already have it on your current Android phone).</p>",
            "<p>The 18W charger returns for fastest charging speeds, but exclusive to the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL (among Pixel phones, at least) is fast wireless charging. The new glass back gives this feature the ability to charge with any Qi charger.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>Google launched its minimalist-looking Pixel Stand wireless charger, which doubles as a way to see notifications and interact with Google Assistant, as if this were a mini Google Home Hub.The stand isn't ideal for traveling (it doesn't fold flat, sadly), but it's a nice option for slightly slower 10W charging on a night stand.

            "<p>Namely, the onscreen home and back buttons have been visually downsized and come with different gestures attached to them. Tapping the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-xs-review\">iPhone XS</a>-like bottom home button bar (no longer a big circular button) sends you home, while swiping up on this flat bar opens the new recent menu to switch between apps. Swiping up further reveals the app drawer. The back button still works as normal, but is smaller than before.</p>",
            "<p>All of this is in an effort to give the Google Pixel 3 extra screen real estate. It\u2019s effective and you\u2019ll get used to the changes, even if it\u2019s painstaking at first. Your muscle memory needs time to adjust.</p>",
            "<p>The trade-off is worth it, though it\u2019s not Earth-shattering. The same goes for the time and the notification icons along the top, as the Android software is now fit for notched displays (even if this phone doesn\u2019t have a screen cut out at the top).</p>",
            "<p>The right-aligned volume slider interface (right next to the physical volume slider) makes it easier to wrap your head around whether you're adjusting call volume or media volume. Essentially, the slider is now dedicated to media, with a smaller on-screen button to toggle vibrate/ringer/silent. We\u2019ve also had less issues with misguided screen rotation thanks to the new software. That's such a small, but meaningful change for everyday use.</p>",
            "<p>Behind-the-scenes tools are even more groundbreaking. Adaptive battery life and adaptive brightness settings free you from having to worry about closing apps to save battery life and adjusting the brightness in different surroundings. Google\u2019s machine-learning software does the heavy lifting by learning your behaviors and taking into account your environment.</p>",
            "<p>We haven\u2019t seen App Slices and App Actions from the operating system, but they\u2019re shortcuts coming soon so that you can access apps (and content within those apps) faster. We\u2019ll update this review as more changes from the the Google Pixel 3 software over the next year.</p>"

            "<p>The Google Pixel 3 is offering a lot, and in a tighter package than most other flagship phones \u2013 the larger Pixel 3 XL included. Chief among them is the single-lens 12.2MP rear camera that delivers slightly better photos and, even more importantly, consistently usable photos compared to the competition. Samsung and LG camera phones occasionally exhibited blurriness or poor low-light performance, and Apple\u2019s iPhone XS Max liked to using warmer than necessary color tones. The Pixel 3 delivered the best pictures each and every time. The one and only time it blurred the foreground subject (us) was when we were wearing sunglasses \u2013 it so relies heavily on subject recognition.</p>",

It puts your selfies into context, especially when you're with a bunch of friends or in front of tall, iconic buildings. There are noticeable funhouse-mirror distortion around the edges if you\u2019re not careful with how your frame your Group Selfie Camera shot.</p>",

This is the one-hand-friendly version of the Pixel 3 XL that your grip will appreciate, and you don\u2019t have to worry about the notch cut out at the top. It\u2019s also cheaper than most other flagship phones in 2018, even if it is more expensive than the Pixel 2. It's not only Google's best camera yet, it's the best camera on any smartphone today.</p>",
            "<p>Yes, if you\u2019re seeking the best camera phone at a reasonable size and a reasonable price. You\u2019ll get the best photos from the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, and the smaller phone is more one-hand-friendly than most flagship handsets. Power users may want to opt for the larger Pixel 3 XL given its larger battery capacity.</p>",
            "<p>The 5.5-inch Google Pixel 3 is best in the hand (singular hand) of someone who wants the best phone camera without having to opt for a handset as big as the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 or iPhone XS Max. It\u2019s priced competitively next to its rival phones, and delivers more consistently rich photos.</p>",

            "<p>Normally, we prefer the bigger screens outright, but the Pixel 3 XL has a hard-to-ignore notch cut out at the top of the display, deeper than the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-xs-max-review\"><u>iPhone XS Max</u></a> notch. It\u2019s a design quirk \u2013 controversial among Pixel fans \u2013 that\u2019s meant to offer a little more room for notification icons, the time, and the battery life percentage, all flanking the selfie cameras and top speaker cut out.</p>",

If you want more space, you\u2019ll have to turn to cloud storage because there\u2019s no microSD card on Pixel phones.</p>",

We prefer this over a dedicated AI button, something that annoys us about Samsung and LG\u2019s new phones with dedicated, often-mispressed AI buttons.</p>",
            "<p>Just know that the Pixel 3 XL doesn\u2019t have a standard 3.5mm headphone jack (exactly like the Pixel 2 XL), though it does come with USB-C earbuds in the box this year. You\u2019re also not going to find a microSD card slot anywhere within the design. The 64GB and 128GB internal storage sizes are set in stone once you order them.</p>",
            "<p>There are three muted Pixel 3 XL colors: Clearly White, Just Black and a pinkish Not Pink. We got two reactions from our Clearly White review unit: that it was the most sophisticated hue or that is looked a little cheap and plasticy. Everyone liked the hint of fresh mint color on the power button, a pleasing dab of color that\u2019s exclusive to the Clearly White version.</p>",
            "<p>The Google Pixel 3 XL has a sizable 6.3-inch OLED screen with a 18.5:9 aspect ratio, a QHD+ resolution, and HDR Support with true black levels.

            "<p>But wait, we found some software tricks to fix this issue: Google\u2019s hidden developer tools menu offers the ability to hide the notch, though the notification icons, time, and battery life percentage are pushed further down. A third-party app, Nacho Notch, is better. It puts all of that information within the blackened notch space. Why this isn\u2019t a part of the phone by default is perplexing.</p>",
            "<p>The notch cut out shouldn\u2019t be a dealbreaker if you want the best-in-class Pixel 3 camera and desire your phone at the biggest size possible. The software tricks certainly help.</p>"

            "<p>The Google Pixel 3 XL captures the best photos of any smartphone we tested to date \u2013 tied with the smaller, spec-matching <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-pixel-3-review\"><u>Google Pixel 3</u></a>. Its photos were often marginally better than those from other flagship phones. And, occasionally, our side-by-side tests showed big differences.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>What sets Google\u2019s 12.2MP rear camera apart is consistency. We got sharper, slightly brighter photos from the Pixel 3 XL camera, while the iPhone XS Max we used at the same time showed overly warm color tones. The <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review\"><u>Samsung Galaxy Note 9</u></a> didn\u2019t always have the best HDR, ending up being second best, while the hit-or-miss <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/huawei-p20-pro-review\"><u>Huawei P20 Pro</u></a> camera frequently oversharpened everything as if its goal was to create a 3D painting that pops out at you.</p>",
            "<p class=\"bordeaux-image-check\"><img src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\" lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image\" onerror=\"this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" sizes=\"auto\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FiFg8627RfsneX3a8NuHva-320-80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FiFg8627RfsneX3a8NuHva-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FiFg8627RfsneX3a8NuHva-650-80.jpg 650w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FiFg8627RfsneX3a8NuHva.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FiFg8627RfsneX3a8NuHva.jpg\"></p>",
            "<p>What\u2019s remarkable is that the Google Pixel 3 XL doesn\u2019t even have the best camera hardware on paper. Its f/1.8 aperture isn\u2019t record-breaking (Samsung and LG are faster at an f/1.5 aperture) and 12.2MP is rather low compared to the 16MP to 40MP camera phones out there.</p>",
            "<p>Behind-the-scenes, Google\u2019s dedicated Pixel Visual Core chip and machine-learning software are the magic that recognize what photos should look like and which shots you\u2019ll actually want. If there\u2019s one thing Google knows how to do, it\u2019s process data and perfect algorithms. That\u2019s pretty much what\u2019s happening here.</p>",
            "<p>The two 8MP front-facing cameras share the rear camera\u2019s machine-learning perks, and for the most part, offer a strong case for the best selfie camera. The primary selfie camera offers a tighter frame at a normal 75 degree field of view, while the secondary selfie camera has a wider 97 degree field of view.</p>",
            "<p>We found that both normal and wide selfies (enabled with an on-screen slider bar) exhibited better HDR and less noise than Google\u2019s competitors. Of course, sometimes you want detail in selfies. And sometimes you really don\u2019t. In some situations, the iPhone XS Max we used at the same time provided tighter, more intimate shots and a bit more natural skin smoothing.</p>",
            "<p class=\"mid__article\"></p>",
            "<p>Wider-angle \u2018Group Selfies\u2019 have their place, telling more about who you\u2019re with or what you\u2019re posing in front of. Whether it\u2019s with a bunch of friends or in front of a famous tall building, we loved being able fit more into a photo, even if the aperture dropped from f/1.8 to f/2.2 between the two cameras.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>Be warned: wielding a wide selfie camera takes work if you want flattering photos. At the wrong angle \u2013 usually at lower angles \u2013 it will make you and your selfie partners\u2019 shirts and upper bodies flare out with barrel distortion at the edges. If you\u2019re taking photos as a couple, you will get in trouble for this. It\u2019s great when it works, and we\u2019re glad it\u2019s here, but unlike the rest of the camera perks, this one doesn\u2019t give you automatic perfection with each shot.</p>",
            "<p>There\u2019s a lot of helpful post-processing going on here, and not the kind we\u2019re used to seeing from China-sourced smartphones that overly rely on Beauty Mode after-effects. When the Pixel 3 XL cleans up photos, it\u2019s to reduce grain from low-light shots, amp up brightness without adding noise, and select the best shot even if you\u2019ve only tapped the shutter button once.</p>",
            "<p>A lot of this post-processing happens automatically, but Google does give you some in-app options.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Top Shot</strong>, for example, is a new feature that allows you to select a new key photo when Motion Photos is turned on. The camera is taking photos before and after you hit the shutter button, so you have access to fleeting moments in which you weren\u2019t blinking or a car didn\u2019t just pass in front of your subject. This ends up being the Pixel 3 XL\u2019s answer to Apple\u2019s Live Photos with the ability to scrub through a small timeline to select a new keyframe. It\u2019s helpful, though, everything but the original photo is in lower resolution, so you may have some tough choices to make.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Super Res Zoom</strong> is surprisingly clear for digital zoom, and the science behind it is fairly deep. It takes advantage of hand-motion in order to capture many frames in order to built a higher resolution (or super resolution) photo. And if you happen to use a smartphone tripod in which the handset is completely still? The camera simulates natural hand motion by intentionally \u2018jiggling\u2019, forcing the OIS module to move between frames, explains Google.</p>",
            "<p>We found Super Res Zoom is be on par and sometimes better than the IPhone XS and Samsung Galaxy Note 9 telephoto lenses. Only the Huawei P20 Pro and its 3x zoom could rival what the Google Pixel 3 XL camera was capable of digitally. It\u2019s all a testament to Google\u2019s insistence on a single-lens rear camera. You\u2019re not missing out, despite what the specs say.</p>",
            "<p>There\u2019s more. Adjustable Portrait Blur allows you to change the amount of bokeh in post, and there\u2019s a new color pop mode that isolates the background in black-and-white while leaving you in color. Night Sight \u2013 coming soon \u2013 is meant to amp up brightness of low-light photos so you don\u2019t need to use that aggressive, photo-ruining flash. And Photobooth uses AI to automatically snap photos, incorporating the idea behind Google Clips right into your smartphone.</p>",
            "<p>The Google Pixel 3 XL camera app doesn\u2019t have everything we want. The simplistic app isn\u2019t as robust as Samsung and LG\u2019s default camera apps. Triggering the selfie camera timer with your hand is missing here, and so is flipping between the front and back cameras with simple swipe gestures. You\u2019re also still not going to find a Hyperlapse mode within this camera app. When it has a truly out there mode like Playground for AR stickers, that\u2019s a bit disappointing.</p>"

            "<p>The larger Pixel 3 XL is the one to get if you\u2019re worried about battery life. Power users will have all-day battery life, and everyone else will get closer to a day and a half from this phone.</p>",
            "<p>We found its 3,430 battery capacity to be solid enough for our daily needs, even if it\u2019s not as big as the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review\"><u>Samsung Galaxy Note 9</u></a> battery at 4,000mAh. It\u2019s closer to the 3,500mAh battery of the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-review\"><u>Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus</u></a>, and Google has some smart power-saving modes in play here.</p>",
            "<p>Adaptive battery, the new <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/android-pie-9-features-release-date-and-phones-list\"><u>Android Pie</u></a> feature to turn off power-hungry apps you don\u2019t use, will get you more battery life, and so will downgrading the pixel count to Full HD+ instead of QHD+. You won\u2019t notice the difference. For us, the Pixel 3 XL lasted about a dozen hours more than the smaller <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-pixel-3-review\"><u>Google Pixel 3</u></a> with its 2,915mAh battery in real life tests.</p>",
            "<p>There\u2019s an 18W charger in the Google Pixel 3 XL box that offers faster charging speeds than a conventional USB charger, and the phone supports fast wireless charging. All Qi chargers worked fine in our testing (though slower than wired charging), and Google i selling a new Pixel Stand if you don\u2019t have a wireless charger yet.</p>",
            "<p>The minimalist-looking Pixel Stand doubles as a way to see notifications, making your Pixel 3 XL a mini <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-home-hub\"><u>Google Home Hub</u></a> of sorts. But we found this stand doesn\u2019t collapse and it\u2019s a bit overpriced at $79. We found Mophie and Samsung\u2019s wireless chargers cheap and easy to travel with.</p>",
            "<p class=\"bordeaux-image-check\"><img src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\" lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image\" onerror=\"this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" sizes=\"auto\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6ApBp6qE2r8eZactuufMdd-320-80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6ApBp6qE2r8eZactuufMdd-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6ApBp6qE2r8eZactuufMdd-650-80.jpg 650w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6ApBp6qE2r8eZactuufMdd.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6ApBp6qE2r8eZactuufMdd.jpg\"></p>",
            "<p class=\"mid__article\"></p>",
            "<p>The Google Pixel 3 XL has been built to offer stable everyday performance, though you won\u2019t find record-breaking speeds from its chipset and RAM configuration.</p>",
            "<p>It uses the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset paired with 4GB of RAM at a time when Google\u2019s rivals are making phones with 6GB and 8GB of RAM. Meanwhile, Apple\u2019s A12 chipset and even the year-older A11 chipset beat the Snapdragon 845 chip handsdown.</p>",
            "<p>Benchmarks, primarily using Geekbench 4 to test overall performance, back up what the specs suggest. The Pixel 3 XL had a multi-core score of 8,350, behind the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-review\"><u>Samsung Galaxy S9</u></a>, and further behind phones like the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review\"><u>Note 9</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/oneplus-6\"><u>OnePlus 6</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-xs-max-review\"><u>iPhone XS Max</u></a>.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>That\u2019s okay for two important reasons. First, we didn\u2019t find any lag from the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-pixel-3-review\"><u>Pixel 3</u></a> or Pixel 3 XL in our extensive daily testing of both phones. Second, this is Google-made hardware that runs pure Android software. We therefore got snappy performance on day one and expect it to be just as good when the next operating system update rolls out, likely in August 2019.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019re not going to notice a drop in performance now, though this phone isn\u2019t as future-proofed as the iPhone XS, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/hands-on-razer-phone-2\"><u>Razer Phone 2</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/asus-rog-phone\"><u>Asus ROG Phone</u></a>. Gamers may want to look elsewhere if they\u2019re primary focus is the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/best-phone-for-gaming\"><u>best gaming phone</u></a> and not the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/best-cameraphone\"><u>best camera phone</u></a>.</p>",
            "<p>The Google Pixel 3 XL is the best way to enjoy the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/android-pie-9-features-release-date-and-phones-list\"><u>Android 9.0 Pie</u></a> interface changes, with a great big screen to soak in the further refined Material Design and battery life-saving benefits.</p>",
            "<p>It comes with stock Android software, which contrasts with the look and feel provided by other Android smartphone makers that liberally alter Google\u2019s software to their liking (and the disliking of \u2018pure Android\u2019 fans). Everything here is how Google has intended it.</p>",
            "<p>You are in for a bit of a change, though. Google\u2019s on-screen navigation buttons along the bottom of the handset have been downsized and require learning new gestures. The home button, for example, has been flattened-out <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-x-review\"><u>iPhone X</u></a>-style and tapping it sends you home. Swiping it up from the bottom opens up the new recent menu, and swiping all the way up reveals the new app drawer location. The back button is similar, but is a bit smaller than before.</p>",
            "<p>Google\u2019s changed UI also makes room for the Pixel 3 XL notch. The time and notification icons reside on the left side of the screen, while icons for LTE, signal strength, and battery life are flush right. The on-screen volume slider is now right-aligned, adjacent to the physical volume slider. This slider is now dedicated to media playback volume, while a small toggle button at the top of the slide dictates whether you\u2019re in ring/vibrate/silent mode.</p>",
            "<p>More than anything, you\u2019ll get more benefit from the new behind-the-scenes effects of the Adaptive Battery Life and Adaptive Brightness settings. Adaptive Battery Life uses Google\u2019s machine-learning smarts to figure out which apps you won\u2019t be using in the future and then reduces their needless energy drain. Adaptive brightness takes into account your surroundings to save you some juice whenever possible.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>There\u2019s more coming to Android Pie, too. App Slices and App Actions were shown off at Google IO, and they enable shortcuts to app (and content within those apps). We\u2019re planning to update this review when these features go live on the Google Pixel 3 XL.</p>"

            "<p>The Google Pixel 3 XL marries the best camera phone we\u2019ve ever tested with a sizable, albeit controversial color-rich 6.3-inch OLED screen. It\u2019s the right fit for people who don\u2019t mind the notch cut out at the top and have already adjusted their grip for bigger smartphones in the past.</p>",
            "<p>Its 12.2MP rear single-lens camera outperforms dual- and triple-lens smartphone cameras. We found its photos more consistently usable than photos from Samsung, Apple and LG\u2019s camera phones. Even digitally zoomed-in pictures looked better, thanks to Google\u2019s machine-learning camera software.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>We\u2019re not sure what we\u2019re more impressed with: the science that happens behind-the-scenes every time we snap a photo, or the actual Google Pixel 3 XL pictures. We were similarly pleased with the twin 8MP cameras, and felt the wide Group Selfie lens came in handy to capture more moments with friends. We just wish the default camera tricks were fleshed out when it came to triggering the selfie camera timer, and that Google had its own take on hyperlapse videos.</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 3 XL is the phone for power users who want an edge in daily picture-taking, and want it with a bigger screen and extra battery life. That said, for most people, we would recommend the smaller 5.5-inch <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-pixel-3-review\"><u>Google Pixel 3</u></a>. It has tighter dimensions for easy one-hand use, and it\u2019s cheaper. Use that saved money for the 128GB of storage version, unless you really need the extended battery life.</p>",
            "<p>Yes, if you\u2019re a power user who wants a big screen with the best camera. When testing a whole series of camera phones, more times than not, we preferred the Google Pixel 3 XL photos. Google\u2019s backend camera software is superior and there are actually more features to come. Just know that the bigger size does come with the notch cut out that you can\u2019t ignore.</p>",
            "<p>The Pixel 3 XL is meant for people with big hands and slightly bigger budgets than the preferred Google Pixel 3. It has the same great camera and snappy performance, but in a bigger size. If your current smartphone has a larger screen, you may not want to downsize. That makes the Google Pixel 3 your top choice if you want to reap the benefits of its top-notch camera.</p>",

            "<p>With similar screen sizes, camera specs, and performance, the 6.3-inch Galaxy S9 Plus is the chief rival of the Google Pixel 3 XL. However, there are some key differences. You won\u2019t find a notch cut out on Samsung\u2019s phone and its screen is slightly curved at the sides for a more elegant look and feel. We also liked using Samsung\u2019s phone triggering gesture-controlled camera timer, and recording hyperlapse and super slow motion videos. But when it comes to more meaningful photo quality Google\u2019s rear-and-front-facing cameras shine.</p>",

While LG\u2019s camera app is more full-featured next to Google\u2019s somewhat thin camera modes, there\u2019s no one big reason to choose the LG V40 over the Google Pixel 3 XL.</p>",

            "<p><strong>Update: </strong><em>A video has shown a phone that's supposedly the Google Pixel 3 Lite in detail, as well as revealing most of the specs.</em></p>",
            "<p>So far, the Pixel range has been exclusively high-end, but that might be all set to change, as numerous leaks and rumors point to a Google Pixel 3 Lite joining the already-available <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-pixel-3-review\">Google Pixel 3</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-pixel-3-xl-review\">Google Pixel 3 XL</a>.</p>",
            "<p>While nothing about the phone is known for sure yet, we have a good idea of what to expect, as leaked images, specs lists and even a video have painted a fairly complete picture.</p>",
            "<p>We\u2019ve collected all the news, leaks and rumors here and will add to this article whenever new information emerges. So read on for all the information so far on the Pixel 3 Lite, when you might see it, and what it might cost.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Hottest leaks:</strong></p>",
            "<p>The only real release date rumor comes from reliable leaker <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/google-could-be-working-on-a-mid-range-pixel-phone-for-next-year\">Roland Quandt</a>, who, back in June 2018, said that a mid-range Pixel device was scheduled for launch during the first half of 2019.</p>",
            "<p>That\u2019s not very specific, but it\u2019s a window that makes sense, as Google is unlikely to launch it too late in 2019 or it could clash with the Pixel 4 range. Though of course it\u2019s always possible that it could land alongside those phones as the Pixel 4 Lite.</p>",
            "<p>As for what the Pixel 3 Lite might cost, the only <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/leaked-photos-may-reveal-the-google-pixel-3-lite\">rumor</a> there puts it at between $400-$500 (roughly \u00a3315-\u00a3390, AU$550-AU$690). That adds up, especially as it\u2019s obviously going to undercut the Pixel 3, which starts at $799 (\u00a3739, AU$1,199).</p>",
            "<p>However, there\u2019s an outside chance that you won\u2019t be able to buy it, as an <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/a-cheaper-google-pixel-3-may-be-in-the-works\">early report</a> suggested that the phone was aimed primarily at emerging markets like India.</p>",
            "<p>But that report is old and didn\u2019t specifically say that the phone wouldn\u2019t get a global launch. With such a big name attached to it we\u2019d think it would probably be widely available.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Hottest leaks:</strong></p>",
            "<p>Our best look yet at the Google Pixel 3 Lite comes from <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/google-pixel-3-lite-fully-revealed-in-hands-on-video\">the video below</a>, which shows it from various angles.</p>",
            "<p>The video claims that the phone is made of plastic and you can see that it has a 3.5mm headphone port and that the speaker is on the bottom edge rather than the front.</p>",
            "<p>The video also says that it has a 5.56-inch, 1080 x 2160 screen with an 18:9 aspect ratio and a pixel density of roughly 434 pixels per inch.</p>",
            "<p>A number of leaked images supposedly showing the Pixel 3 Lite have also emerged, such as <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/pixel-3-lite-pics-have-leaked-heres-how-it-compares-to-the-3-xl-and-iphone-xr\">those in the gallery below</a>, which show it alongside various other handsets.</p>",
            "<p>You can see from these that it\u2019s smaller than the Pixel 3 XL, bigger than the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-xs-review\">iPhone XS</a> and around the same size as the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-xr-review\">iPhone XR</a>. You\u2019ll also note that while there\u2019s no notch there is a sizeable bezel both above and below the screen.</p>",
            "<p class=\"mid__article\"></p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s a design that leaves the Pixel 3 Lite looking a lot like the standard Pixel 3 from the front, while from the back it has a two-tone color scheme like the rest of the Pixel 3 range, in this case in two shades of white. It also has a rear fingerprint scanner.</p>",
            "<p>Another <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/heres-another-unofficial-look-at-the-upcoming-pixel-3-lite\">leaked image</a> shows the Google Pixel 3 Lite next to the standard Google Pixel 3. They look similar, though the Pixel 3 Lite is possibly slightly bigger.</p>",
            "<p>That\u2019s no surprise, as according to <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/leaked-photos-may-reveal-the-google-pixel-3-lite\">an earlier leak</a> which included both images (shown below) and specs, the Pixel 3 Lite has a 5.56-inch screen, which is slightly bigger than the 5.5-inch screen of the Pixel 3.</p>",
            "<p>Though the Google Pixel 3 Lite apparently uses LCD rather than OLED. It\u2019s also said to have a 1080 x 2280 resolution, a 444ppi pixel density (much the same as the Pixel 3) and a plastic rather than glass back. It\u2019s seemingly codenamed Sargo and, as you can see in the images below, appears to have a 3.5mm headphone port.</p>",
            "<p>While we\u2019d take these leaks with a pinch of salt, the photos all look convincing and all match up with one another, as does the video, so there\u2019s a good chance this really is the Pixel 3 Lite that we\u2019re looking at.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Hottest leaks:</strong></p>",
            "<p>From the images and video above, you can see that the Google Pixel 3 Lite has just one camera lens on the back and one on the front. That\u2019s different from the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, which both have two front-facing cameras.</p>",
            "<p>However, the Pixel 3 Lite is rumored to pack the same great 12.2MP lens on the rear as the rest of the range. We\u2019ve also seen <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/google-pixel-3-lite-camera-samples-leak-hints-at-flagship-credentials\">camera samples</a> supposedly taken using the phone, which you can see below.</p>",
            "<p>The same source as those samples says that the phone has an 8MP front-facing camera. This is likely the same lens as one of the selfie cameras on the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. The source doesn\u2019t say which lens the Pixel 3 Lite is lacking, but we\u2019d expect it will be the wide-angle selfie lens that\u2019s absent.</p>",
            "<p>However, there\u2019s more at play in photo quality and camera modes than just the lens. The Google Pixel 3 Lite is sure to have a less powerful chipset than the rest of the range and therefore also a lower-end image signal processor (ISP).</p>",
            "<p>So don\u2019t be surprised if its camera isn\u2019t ultimately as capable as the snapper on the Pixel 3. That said, the same source had previously said that the camera on the Pixel 3 Lite <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/leaked-photos-may-reveal-the-google-pixel-3-lite\">would be just as good as on the rest of the Pixel range</a>. Though it\u2019s not clear whether they\u2019re just talking about the lens there or about the whole experience.</p>",
            "<p>As for the battery, that\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/leaked-photos-may-reveal-the-google-pixel-3-lite\">supposedly 2,915mAh</a>, which would make it exactly the same size as the one in the standard Google Pixel 3. We\u2019ve heard that size from two sources now, with one adding that the longevity of the phone is also similar to the Pixel 3.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Hottest leaks:</strong></p>",
            "<p>The earliest Pixel 3 Lite leaks <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/google-could-be-working-on-a-mid-range-pixel-phone-for-next-year\">pointed to a Snapdragon 710 chipset</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/leaked-photos-may-reveal-the-google-pixel-3-lite\">more recent rumors</a> talk of a slightly lower-end Snapdragon 670. These are both mid-range chipsets though.</p>",
            "<p>We\u2019ve also heard rumors of 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage and \u2013 unsurprisingly given this is a Google device \u2013 no microSD card slot.</p>",
            "<p>Of course, being a Pixel handset this is sure to run pure <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/android-pie-9-features-release-date-and-phones-list\">Android 9 Pie</a> (assuming Android 10 isn\u2019t out by the time this launches) and get day one updates to new versions of the operating system.</p>"
