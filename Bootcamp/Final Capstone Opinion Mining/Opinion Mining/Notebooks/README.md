# Opinion Mining: Information Extraction for Product Development

### Description:

"Opinion Mining" is one of the most useful applications of Data Science in which a pipeline is designed to process and interpret public opinion about various products. The source of this data usually comes from public sources like reviews, article and social media so that the company can gain a diverse understanding of how people feel about their products.

My endeavor with this project is to create a pipeline that solves this problem. So, I developed a Data Science product that collects information from the web, that processes and models the text data, and finally gives an end-user a summary of sentiments concerning their product which they can then use for product development. To take it a step further, this pipeline also applies the same process to another product that's in competition. For the sake of my demo, my target product is an iPhone X, and I compare it to Samsung's Galaxy S9.

### Instructions:
The files are in order of the pipeline required for the entire project. The first file, [00 Scrapy Spiders](https://github.com/ayan1995/Thinkful/tree/master/Bootcamp/Final%20Capstone%20Opinion%20Mining/Opinion%20Mining/Notebooks/00%20Scrapy%20Spiders), contains all the crawlers used to scrape the web.
