            "<p>While you won't catch Apple selling the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-x-review\">iPhone X</a> now that the company has unveiled the new <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-xs-review\">iPhone XS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-xs-max-review\">iPhone XS Max</a>, but you can still buy the previous model at a lower cost elsewhere. It's still a pricey device, though, and nobody likes it when their high-end phone's fancy screen (or glass back) cracks from a bad drop. The best way to keep your phone in one piece is to wrap it in an affordable case that could save you hundreds in repair costs.</p>",
            "<p>Whether you want a rugged iPhone X case to protect the phone from any (and every) misadventure or just a basic plastic sheath to add a bit of armor while still showing off the device's slick looks, there\u2019s a case out there for you.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>Here are our top picks, spanning from affordable, simple protection to complex cases that will make it a lot harder accidentally harm your fancy iPhone X.</p>",

            "<p>The Torras ultra-thin case is exactly what it sounds like: barely a layer between the phone and the environment. While that's not nearly the protection a heftier, multi-material case would offer, this one is better than nothing \u2013 and it keeps your phone slim so you can slip it into a pocket or a small bag.</p>",
            "<p>The case has a small lip around the phone blister \u2013 which should fit both iPhone X and iPhone XS sizes. You can pick one up for $10 <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-iPhone-Plastic-Coating-Compatible/dp/B0759JNCJ3/ref=sr_1_1_sspa\">on Amazon here</a>.</p>",

            "<p>As the newer iPhone XS phases out the old iPhone X, so are the latter's cases nudged out the door with discounts. Just so with this Swarovski-brand case, which - sadly - doesn't include real crystals, but it does have a shiny jeweled back to give that impression.</p>",
            "<p>You can snag one of these for $59 (\u00a345, AU$81) for a sweet 29% off the list price (and the semi-camoflauged color is even a bit cheaper) <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/swarovski-case-for-apple-iphone-x-and-xs-blue/6015400.p?skuId=6015400\" target=\"_blank\">on Best Buy's website</a>.</p>",

            "<p>This is one of the cheapest iPhone X cases on the market right now and it should protect your phone from the odd scratch.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>We don't think it'll be able to do much to protect your device if you drop it though and the gel material probably won't feel as comfortable on your palms as the glass that's on the back of the iPhone X.</p>",
            "<p class=\"bordeaux-image-check\"><img src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\" lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image\" onerror=\"this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" sizes=\"auto\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRo9wCRgfE74WQkuPyM9ZS-320-80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRo9wCRgfE74WQkuPyM9ZS-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRo9wCRgfE74WQkuPyM9ZS-650-80.jpg 650w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRo9wCRgfE74WQkuPyM9ZS.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRo9wCRgfE74WQkuPyM9ZS.jpg\"></p>",
            "<p>TOZO claims this is the world\u2019s thinnest hard-shell case for the iPhone X and while we can\u2019t be sure whether that\u2019s true or not, it\u2019s certainly very slim at just 0.35mm thick.</p>",
            "<p>That makes it a great choice if you don\u2019t want to add any bulk to your fancy new phone, especially given the low price of this case, which should make it all the more appealing if your bank balance is hurting after buying the iPhone X itself.</p>",
            "<p>However, while it will offer some protection against scrapes, we\u2019re not confident that a case this thin will do much to protect your phone from drops.</p>",

            "<p>With the JETech Protective Case you\u2019re getting a lot of case for not very much money at all. It\u2019s a black TPU case \u2013 so far so basic, but it has a carbon fiber design, giving it a bit of flair, and a textured frame for extra grip.</p>",
            "<p>This JETech case also has a built-in metal kickstand, so you can prop your iPhone X up for hands-free viewing, while air cushion technology gives you more drop defense than you might expect.</p>",
            "<p>Ultimately it\u2019s a fairly plain case, and you can get more protection elsewhere, but it looks to strike a good balance between features and price.</p>",
            "<p class=\"bordeaux-image-check\"><img src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\" lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image\" onerror=\"this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" sizes=\"auto\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7PXDRJRgA5i3VrUbCUspYS-320-80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7PXDRJRgA5i3VrUbCUspYS-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7PXDRJRgA5i3VrUbCUspYS-650-80.jpg 650w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7PXDRJRgA5i3VrUbCUspYS.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7PXDRJRgA5i3VrUbCUspYS.jpg\"></p>",
            "<p>Sometimes the simplest option is the best option, and the Spigen Ultra Hybrid iPhone X case is certainly simple.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s available in a range of colors, but they all include a transparent back, so you can see your iPhone X in full while keeping it protected.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s just a simple polycarbonate hard case, but it\u2019s slim, has pronounced button covers so the buttons are easy to find and press, large cut-outs that can fit most cables, and it\u2019s made from a non-slip material, so you\u2019re less likely to drop your phone.</p>",
            "<p>If you do still drop it though the case sports air cushioned corners, which should help keep your iPhone X in one piece.</p>",

            "<p>Most of the options we\u2019ve covered so far have been fairly plain, but the ESR Marble Pattern cover really stands out, with a marble design in black, blue, grey or white.</p>",
            "<p>Beneath the surface it\u2019s a thin and light TPU case, and there\u2019s nothing clever going on here, so you\u2019re only getting basic protection, but it includes a smooth, anti-scratch and anti-fingerprint finish, raised lips to protect the screen and camera, and a low price tag.</p>",

            "<p>The Spigen Neo Hybrid case offers a combination of hard and soft protection to keep you iPhone X safe from nicks and falls. And, it does all that with a slick design, combining grippy PU plastic with a herringbone pattern and hard PC with a metallic paint job. It offers design and protection both at an affordable price.</p>",

            "<p>This one may be one of the best looking cases we've seen for the iPhone X so far and the super thin design means the case shouldn't make your phone much bulgier in your pocket.</p>",
            "<p>It's uncertain how protective that vertical camera cut-out will be, but here you'll get the choice of a variety of colors including a bold blue and green. Those aren't colors you can buy the new iPhone X in.</p>",
            "<p class=\"bordeaux-image-check\"><img src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\" lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image\" onerror=\"this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" sizes=\"auto\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJLLJBH6okY8YCnS84kVWf-320-80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJLLJBH6okY8YCnS84kVWf-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJLLJBH6okY8YCnS84kVWf-650-80.jpg 650w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJLLJBH6okY8YCnS84kVWf.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJLLJBH6okY8YCnS84kVWf.jpg\"></p>",
            "<p>Unlike the choice above, the Tech21 Evo Tactical won't protect the screen of your iPhone X, but you can always buy a screen protector to ensure you don't scratch up that 5.8-inch bezel-less display.</p>",
            "<p>The design of this case should help protect it from drops too, plus you can also use wireless charging without having to peel the case off your phone.</p>",

            "<p>In fact, the case exceeds military drop test standards, so it should keep your iPhone X safer than most, but it also looks good, not just thanks to the aforementioned metal frame, but also because of the back, which comes in a choice of ballistic nylon, black leather, carbon fiber or wood.</p>",
            "<p>That\u2019s an interesting selection of materials, each of which will give the X-Doria Defense Lux case a quite different appearance to most other iPhone X covers.</p>",

            "<p>The fabric yields a very soft, cotton-like feel and slides into the pocket easily. It covers each of the iPhone X's corners, but leaves the buttons exposed for ease of use. Despite its high-quality design, this one comes surprisingly cheap.</p>",

            "<p>Apple began rolling out <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ios-12\"><u>iOS 12.1</u></a> yesterday, adding some great features like group FaceTime calls and over 70 new emoji. Hidden within the excitement, however, is a release note that mentions the Cupertino firm has added its <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-might-be-slowing-down-your-old-iphone-on-purpose\"><u>controversial performance throttling feature</u></a> to the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-8-review\"><u>iPhone 8</u></a>, the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-8-plus-review\"><u>iPhone 8 Plus</u></a> and the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-x-review\"><u>iPhone X</u></a> \u2013 something the tech giant earlier said <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-may-not-throttle-your-iphone-x-or-iphone-8\">would likely not be necessary</a>.</p>",
            "<p>This feature, which made headlines through the end of 2017 and well into 2018, uses an algorithm to reduce the performance of an aging iPhone to protect the electrical components inside and prevent the device from prematurely shutting down.</p>",
            "<p>When the 2017 flagships launched last year, Apple said that the \u201cmodels include hardware updates that allow a more advanced performance management system that more precisely allows iOS to anticipate and avoid an unexpected shutdown\u201d.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>However, according to the iOS 12.1 release notes, the new update \u201cadds a performance management feature [...] for iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus\u201d. Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208387\" target=\"_blank\"><u>support page</u></a> has also been updated with the same language.</p>",
            "<p>There\u2019s a silver lining, though, as Apple allows users to <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-promises-next-ios-update-will-address-iphone-battery-woes\"><u>disable the feature</u></a>, which was included in the iOS 11 release. If you aren\u2019t a fan of your year-old iPhone\u2019s performance being throttled, head to Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Battery Health and check the message below Peak Performance Capability. Note that you\u2019ll see a clickable \u201cDisable\u201d option only if your device\u2019s battery isn\u2019t able to cope.</p>",
            "<p class=\"mid__article\"></p>",
            "<p>While adding the performance throttling feature was a necessary move, according to Apple, to future-proof iPhones, the company faced a series of class action lawsuits and was fined \u20ac5 million in Italy for keeping the feature under wraps till it was exposed by <a href=\"https://www.geekbench.com/blog/2017/12/iphone-performance-and-battery-age/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Geekbench</u></a>.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>At least now Apple is being a bit more upfront about it, and we won\u2019t be surprised to find the newly launched <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-xs-review\"><u>iPhone XS</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-xs-max-review\"><u>iPhone XS Max</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-xr-review\"><u>iPhone XR</u></a> join the list further down the line.</p>",

            "<p>The <strong>iPhone X</strong> is the huge leap forward that Apple's handsets needed after ten years, and it's even better in 2018 thanks to a more stable <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ios-11-release-date-news-and-features\"><em>iOS 11.3</em></a><em> update. </em>Aside from the original iPhone in 2007, this new iPhone is having the biggest impact on Apple\u2019s smartphone direction <em>ever.</em></p>",
            "<p><strong>Update: </strong><em>iPhone X has been updated to iOS 11.3, and </em><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ios-12-what-we-want-to-see\"><em>iOS 12</em></a><em> will launch in beta in a few weeks at Apple's </em><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-wwdc-2018\"><em>WWDC 2018</em></a><em> keynote. We've updated this review to note the software changes.</em></p>",
            "<p><a class=\"fwd-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-final-cut-pro-x\">Read more: Apple Final Cut Pro X</a></p>",
            "<p>Apple itself is calling it the future of the smartphone, the embodiment of what it\u2019s been trying to achieve for a decade. But while the iPhone X is all about premium parts and an all-new experience, it\u2019s a huge gamble for the Cupertino brand too, as it tries to reclaim some leadership in smartphone innovation.</p>",
            "<p>Losing known, reliable elements like the Touch ID fingerprint scanner, the home button; introducing new methods of navigating and unlocking the phone \u2013 and charging a lot more for the privilege \u2013 seems risky for a company that was already treading new ground by doing away with the traditional headphone jack last year.</p>",
            "<p>But the iPhone X is the handset we\u2019ve been demanding from Apple for years \u2013 a world away from the increasingly-tired designs that those who just want a new iPhone have had to make do with.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p><em>Watch our review the of the iPhone X's design below.</em></p>",
            "<p>The fervor around this phone tells that story \u2013 everyone wants to know if the new iPhone X is worth having, partly because it actually represents a <em>new</em> iPhone, and that fervor is such that they don\u2019t seem to care about the cost.</p>",
            "<p>So\u2026 <em>is</em> the iPhone X worth having? Will it change the direction of an industry where many of the specs Apple has put in \u2013 fast charging, wireless charging, bezel-less displays and face recognition \u2013 are already on the market?</p>",
            "<p>We've had the iPhone X in our grasp for a more than six months now, and it's easily one of the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/best-phone\">best smartphones</a> around - but there are still a few things that might throw even long-time Apple fans.</p>",
            "<p class=\"mid__article\"></p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s almost pointless to discuss the iPhone X price \u2013 it\u2019s the most expensive flagship phone on the market, but iPhone users are more willing than most to look past cost.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>But, while the focus here is going to be on the technology, we still need to at least mention the price and release date. It's out now, having launched worldwide on November 3. The price is harder to swallow.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>The iPhone X costs $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,579 for the basic, 64GB model. If you want the larger 256GB model it\u2019s going to cost you $1,149 / \u00a31,149 / AU$1,829 for the privilege.</p>",
            "<p>Word is that Apple said to be launching a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-could-be-making-a-more-affordable-iphone-x-for-2018\">cheaper LCD iPhone variant for 2018</a>, what we're calling the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-9-release-date-news-rumors\">iPhone 9</a> for now, as Apple looks to bring the bezel-less form factor to a lower-cost, non-OLED variant... but that's strictly rumor for now.</p>",
            "<p>The initial issues with stock are now over, and you can grab the handset in a a number of ways - with the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-x-colors\">iPhone X colors</a> pretty limited this year, and the option of two storage sizes your main choices.</p>",
            "<p>So although it's expensive for sure, you can use our <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/deals/iphone-x-deals\">iPhone X deals</a> page (UK only) to ensure you get the best value contract available.</p>",
            "<p>The first thing you\u2019ll notice about the new iPhone is hard to miss: the new screen blazes into your eyes the second you pick up the handset.</p>",
            "<p>The 5.8-inch OLED display is, quite simply, the best thing Apple has ever crammed into an iPhone. It\u2019s leaps ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-8-review\">iPhone 8</a> and 8 Plus for so many reasons: the sharpness, the quality, the fact that it fills the whole front of the phone, and the color reproduction.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s also using a new, longer, screen, but while it looks larger than the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-8-plus-review\">iPhone 8 Plus</a>\u2019 5.5-inch display on paper, it\u2019s only marginally bigger in terms of actual screen real estate \u2013 it\u2019s just stretched upwards, so it's taller, not wider.</p>",
            "<p>OLED technology means you\u2019re getting deeper blacks and more blinding whites, so everything from websites to the photos you take in will look a little better.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>Some will point to the fact that Samsung has been using OLED screens on its phones since the first Galaxy, but Apple counters that by saying it\u2019s only now that the technology is good enough for <em>its</em> phones.</p>",
            "<p>On the face of it that sounds defensive, but when you use the iPhone X you can see it\u2019s a screen that\u2019s incredibly, well, Apple.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s not the sharpest or most colorful screen on a smartphone, but it\u2019s clean, crisp and doesn\u2019t suffer from terrible color shifts when you move it around. It\u2019s a great display to look at from all angles, and that\u2019s what you want on a mobile device.</p>",
            "<p>It's also been dubbed the best in the world, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-x-has-the-best-smartphone-display-ever-thanks-to-samsung\">by the esteemed DisplayMate testing</a>, showing that it's the brightest and more color-accurate OLED on the market and good off-centre brightness shifts - showing Apple can tune the tech from Samsung really well.</p>",
            "<p>The term \u2018bezel-less\u2019 has been bandied about for the iPhone X, but that doesn\u2019t really tell the right story. Yes, there are slight bands around the edges of the screen as this isn't a curved screen iPhone, but they don\u2019t mar the experience \u2013 they give the fingers something to land on, preventing accidental touches of the screen.</p>",
            "<p>Apple could reduce these further in the future and offer a more visually-appealing iPhone, but on the X the experience is still striking.</p>",
            "<p>Talking of visual appeal, the notch at the top of the iPhone X is something that\u2019s been divisive, and that\u2019s fair. Apple has taken this little chunk out of the top of the screen to house the new TrueDepth camera, and it encroaches on the display. A lot newer Android phones, including the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/oneplus-6-hands-on-review\">OnePlus 6</a>, copy this style.</p>",
            "<p>In portrait mode it\u2019s hard to notice it\u2019s there, and the way the notifications bar spills around it is nice.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>However, place the phone in landscape mode and it\u2019s far more noticeable; it\u2019s an irritant when you\u2019re watching movies, as when we wanted to expand them to fill the screen (one of the real beauties of having a longer display) elements of the action were cut out by the notch.</p>",
            "<p>The longer screen is also thinner though - this means there's less real estate for typing. We didn't notice this at the start, but when flipping between the X and an older iPhone, you'll really see there's less space for your digits to tap onto.</p>",
            "<p>While we\u2019re talking about that longer screen, the 18:9 format is something we\u2019ve seen on a number of other phones this year, and in the Android world the apps are largely encoded to fill the display just fine.</p>",
            "<p>On the iPhone X, however, that\u2019s not the case, with many apps we used packing massive black bars above and below the display. That's quickly started to improve though, and each day more apps update for the longer screen.</p>",
            "<p>The issue with apps using the black bars is that it makes the iPhone X look like any other handset from Apple - even an iPhone 3GS \u2013 and given the screen is the main visual differentiator on this phone, and you want every app to fill the display nicely. There are now very few apps left that have these bars above and below, with most expanding the screen to fill the whole front of the phone and curve around the notch.</p>",
            "<p>The new display on the iPhone X also showcases a new feature for Apple: HDR playback. The phone can show movies encoded in the HDR10 and Dolby Vision formats, and combined with the OLED display the images offer so much more depth and realistic color reproduction.</p>",
            "<p>If you\u2019re watching a scene with explosions in it, the effect is incredible on the iPhone X \u2013 much like with all OLED screens.</p>",
            "<p>However, it\u2019s inherently harder to make out detail in darker scenes in HDR movies \u2013 that\u2019s something you\u2019ll need to adjust to.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>Compared to the LCD screen of the iPhone 8 Plus, there are times when you can see less of the action, but compare them side by side and you\u2019ll see that the overall richness, depth and quality for watching movies is just higher on the iPhone X.</p>",
            "<p>Like the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-8-review\">iPhone 8</a> and 8 Plus, the X uses a True Tone display, which mimics the lighting conditions around it and will adjust the white balance accordingly. It\u2019s not a reason to buy the phone on its own, but it\u2019s a really premium little extra that you\u2019ll grow to like.</p>"

            "<p>Face ID \u2013 Apple\u2019s facial recognition system that replaces the fingerprint-scanning Touch ID \u2013 is simple to set up, with the iPhone X encouraging you to put your face into view at the start; spin your head around a couple of times and you're ready to go.</p>",
            "<p>That's all you need to do in order to be able to unlock your phone with your face, and as long as the iPhone X can see your eyes, nose and mouth you'll be able to get into your handset easily.</p>",
            "<p><a class=\"fwd-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-final-cut-pro-x\">Read more: Apple Final Cut Pro X</a></p>",
            "<p>And we really do mean easily \u2013 Face ID has far, far exceeded our expectations for the new biometric technology. We've used facial recognition on other phones many times, and it's been erratic and, well, terrible.</p>",
            "<p><em>Watch our review of FaceID below.</em></p>",
            "<p>Apple's facial recognition tech is leagues ahead of anything else on the market right now \u2013 it's proved almost flawless in our testing.</p>",
            "<p>Whether you\u2019re in a pitch-black room, in low light or on the move, you simply raise the iPhone X up, look at the screen and you're unlocked, and it\u2019s the same for both unlocking the phone and using apps. As mentioned, we were worried this might be a sticking point for the iPhone, but Apple has nailed it.</p>",
            "<p>That said, some people are finding a few issues with the service \u2013 our US mobiles editor Matt Swider has noted that it doesn't catch his face every time, for instance. While we said it works on the move if you raise your iPhone to your face, if it catches <em>part</em> of your face, it'll fail and eventually lock you out of your phone and require a passcode. Some people will yearn for the days of the Touch ID fingerprint sensor.</p>",
            "<p>So that's not to say there won't be some transition required for existing iPhone users. There's a slight, slight delay to unlocking at times (although it doesn't get in the way), and you need to be looking at the handset to make it work \u2013 although we did manage to unlock ours while looking elsewhere at times.</p>",
            "<p>It can even work if you\u2019re wearing sunglasses, as long as the infrared scanner that's actually checking out your face can penetrate the lenses. It won\u2019t work in all cases \u2013 it depends if your shades are able to let the infrared beam pass through.</p>",
            "<p>However, we\u2019d guess that in such instances you\u2019ll need to hold the phone a little closer, or use your passcode \u2013 much like when you can\u2019t open an older iPhone using Touch ID because you\u2019ve got a wet thumb.</p>",
            "<p class=\"bordeaux-image-check\"><img src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\" lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image\" onerror=\"this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" sizes=\"auto\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7jczCojTHkYxbUSEL6YsP-320-80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7jczCojTHkYxbUSEL6YsP-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7jczCojTHkYxbUSEL6YsP-650-80.jpg 650w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7jczCojTHkYxbUSEL6YsP.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7jczCojTHkYxbUSEL6YsP.jpg\"></p>",
            "<p class=\"mid__article\"></p>",
            "<p>A bigger issue will be if you're someone who leaves their iPhone flat on the desk, and uses their thumb to check out notifications \u2013 you'll now have to pick the phone up and look into the screen to see your updates.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>We compared the two unlock methods side by side, and it was at that point that we realized Touch ID is a little faster than Face ID \u2013 which makes us start to wonder why Apple changed things at all.</p>",
            "<p>While Face ID is a brilliant implementation of facial recognition, and is more secure, it's still not as predictable as your finger finding the same spot time and time again to unlock your device.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>We get that there's no space for the home button any more, but there's no reason why Apple couldn't have shoved the fingerprint scanner onto the side of the phone, in the same way as on Sony handsets.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>We suspected that Apple might have been experimenting with this option, given that the side button is now larger than before, but <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2017/10/31/how-apple-built-the-iphone-x/#w6TVIovFtSqR\"><u>Apple\u2019s designers are claiming such a thing was never a consideration</u></a>.</p>",
            "<p>Another issue with Face ID as against Touch ID is when using Apple Pay. Where previously you'd approach the reader with your thumb over the home button and it would instantly verify the payment, with the iPhone X you'll need to double-tap the side button to activate Face ID, have it register your face, and then it'll be ready to pay.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>It's not a tough system to master \u2013 after a single attempt we were able to replicate it time and again \u2013 but it's not as easy as before, which is irritating.\u00a0You'll sometimes believe you double-tapped the side button, <em>think</em> you didn't actually double tap it, tap it one more time to be sure, and realize you did double tap initially and triple tapped. This turns off the phone right as Apple Pay pops up, making your quick payment slower than paying with cash. Sometimes the Apple Pay menu is too slow.</p>",
            "<p>Face ID is enabled by the TrueDepth camera, which is housed in the notch at the top of the phone, and one has to wonder whether Apple has shifted to the facial recognition technology to simply have something new and exciting to help sell the new iPhone.</p>",
            "<p>There's no doubting that the facial mapping camera is powerful \u2013 it's incredibly accurate \u2013 but there's not much you can do with it right now, as few apps have taken advantage of the feature. Given the TrueDepth camera is probably adding a fair bit to the cost, perhaps that's part of the reason to push Face ID.</p>",
            "<p>Another thing the TrueDepth camera facilitates is Portrait mode, where the background is blurred in your selfies, and it's excellent.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>We'll speak more about that in the camera section, but the new technology has allowed Apple to create one of the best front-facing cameras on the market.</p>",
            "<p>You've probably heard a fair bit about Animoji already, the feature that enables you to create talking emoji using the TrueDepth camera and your own face.</p>",
            "<p>It's a really fun system \u2013 you can be a talking robot, cat, dog, unicorn or piece of poo, among other avatars. The impressive thing, though, isn't that you can send an animated emoji to your friends, but the sheer accuracy of the facial mapping.</p>",
            "<p>Whether that's a flicker of the eyebrows making a unicorn's ears flap, or raised eyebrows pushing an alien's brow upwards... it's something you won't have seen elsewhere to this level of quality.</p>",
            "<p>But it's a massive novelty. It's not something you're going to buy this phone for, and after a few days you'll forget it's there. This is very much something Apple does \u2013 adding in a feature that's not a deal-breaker, but which could be useful in the future.</p>",
            "<p>And while you can share the videos with friends in apps other than iMessage, it's not easy to do. And if your friends don't have an iPhone X, you can still send them Animoji, but they'll want to reciprocate and won\u2019t be able to. This feature really needs to roll out to other apps - or at least those developers need to code in a similar option. Apple hasn't done that yet, though it has added four new Animoji masks with the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ios-11-release-date-news-and-features\">iOS 11.3 update</a>.</p>",
            "<p>This is a feature that will delight children, and we can see how developers could create some really cool apps for kids using the front-facing camera on the iPhone X; but we're still in the 'wait and see' phase as to whether the TrueDepth camera is going to be a gamechanger or just a nice piece of expensive hardware.</p>"

            "<p><em>Watch our review of the UI and performance of the iPhone X below.</em></p>",
            "<p>If you\u2019re running a recent iPhone, perhaps something from the iPhone 6 and above, then you\u2019ve probably already tried out <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ios-11-release-date-news-and-features\">iOS 11</a>\u2026 but it\u2019s rather different on the iPhone X.</p>",
            "<p>The main difference is the home button \u2013 or lack thereof, as you\u2019ve probably already noticed. This has been replaced by gestures, and suddenly Apple\u2019s desire to get all swipey in previous iterations of iOS makes sense today.</p>",
            "<p><a class=\"fwd-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-final-cut-pro-x\">Read more: Apple Final Cut Pro X</a></p>",
            "<p>Swiping up from the bottom of the screen no longer launches the Control Center, but rather serves as a return to home button. This takes a lot of getting used to, but it quickly becomes embedded in the muscle memory.</p>",
            "<p>Within a few days we were trying the same action on other phones out of habit, and it\u2019s reminiscent of the way you\u2019ll open up the menu on a Samsung phone \u2013 it just feels like it\u2019s in the right place.</p>",
            "<p>However, beyond that Apple has made things a little too convoluted. To open the deck of running apps, for example, you need a \u2018demi-swipe\u2019 upwards\u2026 go too far and you\u2019ll just access the home screen.</p>",
            "<p>To shut down said apps, it\u2019s no longer a swipe but a press <em>then</em> a swipe. This doesn\u2019t feel intuitive at all, and shows Apple had to reach a little too far to integrate all the functionality into gestures.</p>",
            "<p>We must say that although we didn't like the gesture where you swipe right on the bottom of the screen to move between recently-used apps at launch, it's grown on us and suddenly makes more sense to use. Apparently it makes sense to Google too, as the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/android-p-what-we-want-to-see-from-android-9\">Android P</a> uses this functionality, too.</p>",
            "<p>The Control Center now lives to the right of the notch at the top of the phone, with the notifications panel on the left. This <em>does </em>make sense, and we actually prefer the placement of these two \u2013 having the Control Center at the bottom got in the way of too many apps in the past.</p>",
            "<p class=\"mid__article\"></p>",
            "<p>If you\u2019re using the iPhone X in landscape mode though, you\u2019re going to run into trouble. It appears that without the notch there to separate them, the notifications panel takes up the bulk of the space at the expense of the more-useful Control Center, and you\u2019ll need to swipe from <em>exactly </em>in the top right-hand corner to get access to the latter.</p>",
            "<p>On to day-to-day use of the iPhone X, though, this thing is buttery smooth, with nary a glitch in sight (apart from Animoji, which kept freezing on us). That\u2019s the benefit of bringing out a phone with the new version of iOS out on the market \u2013 a lot of the kinks have been ironed out.</p>",
            "<p>There\u2019s a powerful engine at the heart of this iPhone, with the A11 Bionic chip running in tandem with 3GB of RAM (<a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-x-battery-size-and-ram-seemingly-revealed\"><u>according to Chinese filings</u></a>). That doesn\u2019t sound like much RAM, but it\u2019s the most Apple has ever chucked into a phone, and it shows in the speed of use.</p>",
            "<p>If you look at the Geekbench scores, which assess the raw power of the processor, the iPhone X is one of the most powerful phones on the market, only rivaled by the iPhone 8 Plus.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p class=\"bordeaux-image-check\"><img src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\" lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image\" onerror=\"this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" sizes=\"auto\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AySxE9CqeYLiMzYD6qPTUf-320-80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AySxE9CqeYLiMzYD6qPTUf-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AySxE9CqeYLiMzYD6qPTUf-650-80.jpg 650w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AySxE9CqeYLiMzYD6qPTUf.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AySxE9CqeYLiMzYD6qPTUf.jpg\"></p>",
            "<p>And while you can\u2019t say how good a smartphone is based on its scores, we\u2019ve seen nothing during our tests to suggest this is anything other than an incredibly powerful phone.</p>",
            "<p>There\u2019s very little judder anywhere (although in low-power mode everything does slow down a lot \u2013 far too much for a simple power saving when there\u2019s this much power coursing through the iPhone X), and that\u2019s a sign of a well-optimized handset.</p>",
            "<p>Gaming on the iPhone X is predictably strong too \u2013 we\u2019re at the point now where there are barely any titles that don\u2019t play well on flagship devices, given the amount of power under the hood.</p>",
            "<p>The new penchant for AR gaming, where games are played within a within a plane overlaid on your real-world surroundings, is a key part of Apple\u2019s new strategy and we managed a game of The Machines with aplomb (and that title has already been optimized for the iPhone X\u2019s screen, pleasingly).</p>",
            "<p>The other thing is that top gaming titles look bright and colorful on the OLED display, so all in all the iPhone X is a top choice for gaming. The only downside is that gaming seems to deplete the battery rather quickly, but that\u2019s nothing new from Apple.</p>",
            "<p>And don\u2019t forget about the excellent Taptic Engine (the vibrating motor) inside \u2013 this might have appeared in previous iPhones, but it really enhances gaming.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll get a real sense of a machine-gun firing, taking hits yourself, or flipping through a list with a real clicking feel in the hand.</p>"

            "<p>The design of the iPhone X is very much a mix of old and new. The new parts are obvious: this is a phone with very little bezel, a glass back and no home button.</p>",
            "<p>But it's also got the familiar rounded shape in the hand \u2013 in fact, it harks back to the days of the iPhone 3G, feeling similar when picked up.</p>",
            "<p><a class=\"fwd-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-final-cut-pro-x\">Read more: Apple Final Cut Pro X</a></p>",
            "<p>What you will sense when holding the iPhone X for the first time is that this is a premium handset. It <em>feels </em>expensive, with the weighty steel rim on the outside blending in impressively with the curved glass all around.</p>",
            "<p>The silver version of the X comes with a polished stainless steel band, while the black option has a similar dark coloring that's been attached through a process called vapor deposition.\u00a0It's also why we may not see a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/product-red-iphone-x\">red iPhone X</a>.</p>",
            "<p>That means the band\u2019s color isn\u2019t\u00a0painted on... it's inside the metal itself, giving the premium feel we're used to from Apple. A word of warning: after a few days carrying the phone in the pocket, unencumbered by an <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/best-iphone-x-cases\">iPhone X case</a>, we started to see a few examples of scuffing on the rim, so it's worth thinking about putting this in a case, or at the very least a skin, if you want to keep it looking nice.</p>",
            "<p>While it weighs less than the iPhone 8 Plus (174g compared to 202g), the iPhone X feels a lot heavier in the hand, in a good way.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p class=\"mid__article\"></p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll feel like this is a strong, solidly build handset (and don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s still IP67 water-resistant) and you\u2019d be right \u2013 despite it being glass front and black, Apple believes it's made the strongest iPhone yet.</p>",
            "<p>We really don't feel that you could bend the iPhone X by sitting on it...</p>",
            "<p>One negative thing to say about the design: it's a smudge sucker. The outer band gets covered in fingerprints in no time at all, and the glass front and back will happily accept any oil your fingers want to deposit on them.</p>",
            "<p>And while the rear of the phone is glass, as on the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, there\u2019s a different design language at play with the iPhone X. Every button is elegantly embedded into the rim of the phone, yet there\u2019s a sharpness to each key that comes from them being machined in a certain way.</p>",
            "<p>The same is true of the protruding camera bump on the rear of the phone \u2013 the edge is sharp, where on the iPhone 8 it rolls into the case. This shows that Apple is taking a new design direction with the X, hinting at the short-term future of iPhone design.</p>",
            "<p>In terms of how the iPhone X feels in the hand, well, it\u2019s surprisingly easy to use one-handed. It balances naturally in the hand, with the glass and metal combination feeling grippy enough to do so, and most thumbs will be able to roam comfortably over the slippery surface like a little flesh-colored penguin.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll need to drag down the notifications panel and Control Center with the digits of your other hand on most occasions, but generally the iPhone X is a good mix of phablet-sized screen while being ergonomic enough to use in one hand.</p>",
            "<p>A special mention to Apple for the way it\u2019s incorporated the speakers into this tightly-packaged phone \u2013 the sound is really something, with full volume making the phone reverberate with audio.</p>",
            "<p>Despite one of the speakers firing downwards from the bottom of the iPhone X, you can easily listen to movies without headphones \u2013 and the irritated glances from colleagues when we tested out this phone in the office shows that the sound can carry pretty far too.</p>",
            "<p>There have been reports of a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/dozens-of-iphone-x-users-are-reporting-crackling-speakers\">crackling speaker in some models</a> - however, we've not seen that in the wild and our model was able to crank to full volume with ease.</p>",
            "<p>In terms of sound, it\u2019s worth reiterating that there\u2019s no headphone jack on the new iPhone range \u2013 Apple has made a big bet that it can convince users to leave their 3.5mm headphones behind for <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/hi-fi-and-audio/headphones/apple-airpods-1328292/review\">AirPods</a>, but it still annoys for now if you don\u2019t have a decent pair of Bluetooth headphone or lose the adapter that comes in the box.</p>"

            "<p><em>Watch our review video outlining the camera on the iPhone X below.</em></p>",
            "<p>The camera on the iPhone X is very similar to the one on the iPhone 8 Plus, with some small differences.</p>",
            "<p>For instance, while both have a dual 12MP sensor array (for taking zoomed-in pictures, or capturing depth perception in a scene) the iPhone X has an f/2.4 aperture, where on iPhone 8 Plus it\u2019s f/2.8, and only the wide-angle lens has optical image stabilization.</p>",
            "<p><a class=\"fwd-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-final-cut-pro-x\">Read more: Apple Final Cut Pro X</a></p>",
            "<p>It was also been dubbed the best camera on the market by DxOMark, although only for still images, showing the technical prowess of the sensor (it's since we surpassed by the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/huawei-p20-pro-review\">Huawei P20 Pro</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-review\">Samsung Galaxy S9</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-review\">S9 Plus</a>).</p>",
            "<p>Before we get too far into the performance of the rear camera, let's talk about the front-facing TrueDepth camera, which is a 7MP affair but with some smart capabilities to make the iPhone one of the best selfie-taking cameras on the market.</p>",
            "<p>The camera, as the name suggests, can sense depth incredibly well, so the new Portrait mode \u2013 debuted on the iPhone 8 Plus \u2013 can be used with the front-facing camera to take excellent selfies.</p>",
            "<p>Not only will this blur the background, you can also use the Portrait options to change the lighting of the scene, or cut yourself out of the picture altogether and place yourself on a black background.</p>",
            "<p>The lighting alterations, adding things like contoured lighting to your visage, don't really add a huge amount, and some of the 'stage lighting' pictures that cut you out of the image don't always trace the edges of your head and body perfectly.</p>",
            "<p>But when it does work, the iPhone X's camera is out of this world \u2013 it delivers stunning shots that are rich with detail, and while it's not the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/best-cameraphone\">best smartphone camera</a> on the market it takes natural-looking photos very well, and that's something a lot of people will celebrate.</p>",
            "<p>Those pictures look far better on the X\u2019s OLED display too, thanks to the improved contrast ratios and better colors, although sharing the same pictures to an Apple TV shows they\u2019re a little brighter than on the phone screen.</p>",
            "<p>While the iPhone X is a long way from being the first handset from Apple to use Live Photos, this feature is improved in <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ios-11-release-date-news-and-features\">iOS 11</a> \u2013 being able to loop, bounce or long-expose photos is a fun little extra that you can share with friends well.</p>",
            "<p>The overall speed of snapping and quality of the iPhone X camera is strong, as you\u2019d expect from a flagship handset from Apple with the new A11 Bionic chip inside.</p>",
            "<p>Low-light performance is a touch better than from previous iPhones \u2013 although it\u2019s curious the way the iPhone 8 Plus and X have different apertures, yet deliver the same kind of zoomed-in low-light performance.</p>",
            "<p class=\"mid__article\"></p>",
            "<p>In real terms, the f/2.4 aperture and optical image stabilization on the zoom lens should mean better low-light photos, but when you\u2019re zoomed in sometimes you\u2019re not actually using the optical lens (which is designed for the task) in favor of\u00a0the more dark-adept 'main' lens.</p>",
            "<p>This is a good thing. Instead of using the zoomed-in sensor for low-light pictures, the iPhone X uses the wide-angle lens (which has better low light capabilities) and uses \u00a0digital zoom to get the best looking snaps.</p>",
            "<p>It's hard to say why Apple has bothered to improve the other sensor if this is what it's going to do, but the main thing is picture quality and that's coming through well.</p>",
            "<p>Some of the shots from the iPhone X are astonishing \u2013 the performance in lower light conditions, when the light is fading, is really strong, although the slower shutter speeds do lead to a touch more noise and blur.</p>",
            "<p>The camera could do with booting a touch faster from the lock screen (although you can now 3D Touch - push hard - on the photography icon to load the camera, rather than swiping), but generally it\u2019s hard to fault the natural, clear and crisp photos you\u2019ll get from the iPhone.</p>",
            "<p>The rear Portrait mode is one of the better options on the market, but sometimes it doesn\u2019t quite find the edge of items it\u2019s trying to depth-sense \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-pixel-2-review\">Google Pixel 2</a> actually does it better with a single lens, although the effect on both is sensational when it works correctly.</p>",
            "<p>It is worth pointing out that \u2018standard\u2019 iPhone pictures have a nice level of background blur automatically, with the focal length automatically finding a nice depth of field for whatever you\u2019re trying to snap.</p>",
            "<p>Video capabilities on the iPhone X are also among the best on the market, with the 4K recording at 60 frames per second delivering clear, fluid images, albeit images that will take up a fair bit of space on your device.</p>",
            "<p>If you\u2019re thinking of using the iPhone X as a videographer, you\u2019ll probably want to go for the more expensive 256GB capacity option, as there\u2019s no way to expand the storage here aside from relying on iCloud.</p>"

            "<p>The battery on the iPhone X is, according to the same Chinese regulatory filing as we mentioned earlier, is 2,716mAh, which makes it a touch larger than the iPhone 8 Plus.</p>",
            "<p>That's quite a large power cell from Apple, but given the larger screen with more pixels to power, it makes sense.</p>",
            "<p><a class=\"fwd-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-final-cut-pro-x\">Read more: Apple Final Cut Pro X</a></p>",
            "<p>While the iPhone X battery life isn't mind-blowing, it's certainly better than some iPhones of old - it's more than acceptable.</p>",
            "<p class=\"mid__article\"></p>",
            "<p>Some real world use: in heavy testing, we managed to run the iPhone down in just a shade over 12 hours.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>But that included 30 minutes of Netflix trying HDR mode, walking to work and listening to Bluetooth music on Spotify, using a portable hotspot on the train, taking sample images with the camera and testing Face ID over and over, and playing some games.</p>",
            "<p>The next day, it got closer to 9PM with a slightly lighter load, but still spending a lot of time testing - both of these were expected. It was also impressive how long the iPhone X held on while watching a movie with only 5% battery left and power-saving mode turned on... we got a good 35 minutes of watching before it finally gave up.</p>",
            "<p>But when put into lighter use - just pulling the iPhone X out once in a while to send a message, take a few pictures at a wedding and navigate on GPS for around 30 minutes, we were at 25% by midnight.</p>",
            "<p>And overnight it only lost 5% battery life before the morning - again, a good result. It's not the <em>absolute </em>best we've seen from a phone, but if you're someone that suffers with an iPhone that drains quickly you'll be pleased with what's on offer here, and most days you'll get home with plenty of power to spare.</p>",
            "<p>Based on the data that we've pulled from using the iPhone X in a variety of scenarios, we've found that it'll last a good 18 hours per day with some heavier usage - that includes a tonne of Bluetooth streaming, WhatsApp, Facebook and browsing the internet, all things that are pretty tough on the battery.</p>",
            "<p>The reason it seems to do better than some might expect is the screen - the OLED technology has proven to be very effective at sucking less battery.</p>",
            "<p>That's shown in our testing: we ran the same 90 minute, Full HD video at full brightness from 100% charge - and the iPhone X set a record-breaking score for an Apple handset.</p>",
            "<p>Where most (including the iPhone 8 Plus) lost around 25% battery, the iPhone X managed an incredible 10% drop - that's unheard of in our tests, and given the X has more pixels to drive from the same A11 Bionic chipset on the 8 Plus, it's only the OLED technology that's the differentiator.</p>",
            "<p>This isn't the first iPhone that can support wireless charging - that title goes to the iPhone 8 - but it's a really convenient feature and we'd suggest investing in a decent pad for home and work, so you'll never have to worry about running low on juice while being able to easily pick it up and put it down.</p>",
            "<p>The good news is that <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ios-112-will-deliver-faster-wireless-charging-to-iphone-x-and-iphone-8\">Apple has since enabled even faster charging through the wireless pads</a> - nothing major, but should mean you get more boost from a few minutes of being plopped down on the charger.</p>",
            "<p>In terms of time to charge, the iPhone X took 2 hours and 15 minutes to charge fully from dead (with Airplane mode turned on), which is about average, although we used a larger iPad charging block for faster juicing.</p>",
            "<p>You'll get 20% battery life with 15 minutes of charge, and that should get you home in a pinch.</p>",
            "<p>You <em>can</em> also buy a USB-C Lightning cable and block to get fast charging capabilities - reported to be 50% battery from 30 minutes of power - but that costs $75 / \u00a375 / AU$100 to buy the cable and block... which is pretty pricey for the privilege of faster powering up.</p>",
            "<p>The A11 Fusion chip inside this phone is one of the probably reasons for the improvement in battery life - with more efficient cores and a 10nm manufacturing process (which means things are closer together, and more efficient) Apple has worked hard on bringing both power and efficiency to the iPhone X.</p>",
            "<p>This phone is more of a phablet than a standard phone in terms of screen and battery size, and that shows in the fact it's similar to the iPhone 8 Plus in terms of time between charges.</p>",
            "<p>Does the iPhone X have good battery life? It's pretty good - nothing to write home about but if you've had another Apple handset for a few years you'll be very pleased with how well it lasts during the day.</p>"

            "<p>Let\u2019s get one thing out of the way first: the iPhone X is not a phone for the Android fan. This is a phone for someone who\u2019s entrenched in the iPhone ecosystem and doesn\u2019t want to leave, but has become bored to tears by the same old design from Apple for the last four years.</p>",
            "<p>The iPhone X is the phone we\u2019ve been willing Apple to make, partly so that we\u2019ve got something new to write about, but also so those who look forward to the arrival of a new iPhone actually have something to get excited about.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p><a class=\"fwd-link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-final-cut-pro-x\">Read more: Apple Final Cut Pro X</a></p>",
            "<p>\u2018New Phone Day\u2019 is one of the highlights in many people\u2019s years, and the iPhone X is worthy of the excitement.</p>",
            "<p>Apple has got things almost entirely right with the iPhone X, taking all it\u2019s learned from its past handsets and fusing them together to make a device that\u2019s like nothing else the brand has ever produced.</p>",
            "<p>See our overview video of the iPhone X below.</p>",
            "<p>In our opinion, the greatest iPhone before the X was the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/iphone-4-694980/review\">iPhone 4</a>, which elevated Apple from \u2018poor specs but great user experience\u2019 to a real smartphone contender, fusing strong design with decent performance.</p>",
            "<p>But the iPhone X takes things in a whole new direction, offering users something they\u2019ve never had before in the iOS world. We're annoyed it's taken this long to get an OLED screen on an Apple phone, but now that we've got one there's not a lot to fault on the iPhone X.</p>",
            "<p>The selfie camera, the raw power, the all-new screen shape and the well-implemented Face ID combine impressively to create a new direction for the iPhone.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s interesting that Apple says the iPhone X is the future of smartphones, however, because many of its new features are already present on other handsets on the market. The X is not going to make waves in the same way the original iPhone did.</p>",
            "<p>But in terms of the future of iPhones\u2026 well, this is it. Anything that\u2019s not the iPhone X now just looks dated and slathered in bezel. The iPhone X is indeed the Apple handset of the future, and everything else it\u2019s made is history.</p>",
            "<p>Just think about handing this phone to someone who\u2019s got the first iPhone in 2007 \u2013 that 3.5-inch-screened metal-and-plastic fusion, with a terrible camera, grainy screen, no apps and a swipe to unlock.</p>",
            "<p>The iPhone X is a smooth, machined, waterproof phone with a superb high-res screen, 256GB of storage, millions of apps, lightning download speeds, AR effects, instant facial recognition, amazing speakers, sublime photos from the front and back cameras, console-level gaming\u2026 the iPhone X serves as powerful reminder to sometimes step back and see how far we\u2019ve come.</p>",
            "<p>Is it perfect? Of course not \u2013 it's so, so expensive. No matter how good the phone is, the extreme cost puts it out of reach of so many smartphone fans.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>The notch on the iPhone X irks, the bezels are a little too heavy to call it bezel-less, the camera isn\u2019t market-leading (although it\u2019s very, very good), and despite all the technical innovation it\u2019s impossible to look past the dizzying cost.</p>",
            "<p>That said, the iPhone X is the closest to perfection Apple has ever got with an iPhone \u2013 and if you\u2019re okay with the sky-high price, you\u2019re going to love it.</p>",

Its curved Super OLED display and rear-mounted fingerprint sensor make it pleasing in both form and functionality. You're also going to love the photos, and the fact that it's slightly cheaper than Apple's launch price.</p>",

            "<p>Okay, the chances are you\u2019re not going to pick up an older Samsung phone if you\u2019re looking at buying the iPhone X, but it\u2019s definitely worth considering. It also uses OLED technology \u2013 and is pretty nifty \u2013 at it, in our opinion, and it packs an industry-leading camera.\u00a0</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s a cheaper phone too \u2013 partly due to the original price, and also from being on the market a few months and the cost declining. But few people are likely make the switch from Apple\u2019s ecosystem to Android\u2019s...</p>",

            "<p>A left-field choice here, but the LG V30 is a powerhouse of a phone, if one that lacks the polish of the iPhone X.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s got a great mix of a longer, lower-bezel screen, a strong camera and great audio output, and still packs a fingerprint scanner. One to go for if you want something with brawn but at a touch lower cost.</p>"
