            "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-6t-review/\">OnePlus 6T</a>\u00a0does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack, meaning to enjoy listening to music on the phone, you either have to deal with a dongle, use OnePlus\u2019s own USB Type-C Bullets headphones, or turn to a wireless Bluetooth connection. The good news is, OnePlus continues to be one of the <a href=\"https://www.aptx.com/products?field_product_category_tid=126&amp;field_aptx_type_tid=483\">few manufacturers</a> that adds\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.aptx.com/aptx-hd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bluetooth AptX HD</a> into its phones. It\u2019s a wireless audio codec that provides a greater-than-CD quality sound when using compatible wireless headphones.</p>",
            "<p>To <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/aptx-hd-vs-chord-mojo/\">experience AptX HD</a>, you need to follow a few simple stages to get it working. Here\u2019s our guide to enjoying AptX HD on your OnePlus 6T. If you haven\u2019t bought a OnePlus 6T yet, read our <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-6t-review/\">OnePlus 6T review</a>\u00a0to find out why you should.</p>",
            "<p>Owning the OnePlus 6T gets you only halfway to AptX HD audio nirvana. You also need an AptX HD-ready pair of headphones. That\u2019s right, your old pair of well-used in-ears that came free with an old phone won\u2019t cut it here. You\u2019re going to have to splash out, but it\u2019s worth it.</p>",
            "<p>The easiest way to find out what headphones are ready for AptX HD is visit <a href=\"https://www.aptx.com/products?field_product_category_tid=125&amp;field_aptx_type_tid=483\">the AptX website</a>, where you\u2019ll find a complete, up-to-date list of compatible hardware. We are particular fans of the superb <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/headphone-reviews/sony-wh-1000xm2-review/\">Sony WH-1000xM2</a> headphones, the amazing <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/audio-technicas-ath-dsrbt9-aptx-hd-bluetooth-headphones-were-almost-never-made/\">Audio Technica ATH-DSR9BT</a> over-ears, and the excellent\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/headphone-reviews/bowers-and-wilkins-px-headphones-review/\">Bowers &amp; Wilkins PX</a> noise canceling headphones.</p>",
            "<p>More products are being released with AptX HD support all the time, so if you don\u2019t find a pair to suit right now, do keep checking back.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ve got your OnePlus 6T, and the right pair of Bluetooth headphones all ready to go. Now, we need to prepare and then pair them together. Here are the stages you need to follow:</p>",
            "<p>That\u2019s it. You\u2019re now set up for the best wireless audio quality you\u2019ll hear.</p>",
            "<p>When you use AptX HD and play hi-res files, the sound is as close to high resolution audio quality usually provided by wired headphones as you\u2019ll get. It plays up to 48kHz/24-bit LPCM audio, and it\u2019s genuinely unlike any wireless Bluetooth experience you\u2019ll have had before. To get this, you should use hi-res sources, such as <a href=\"http://tidal.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tidal HiFi</a>, or your own hi-res music files.</p>",
            "<p>Playing regular MP3 files, or music from <a href=\"https://www.spotify.com/uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spotify</a>, will sound better using AptX HD; but it won\u2019t be the eye-opening experience you\u2019ll have with hi-res content.</p>"

            "<p><a href=\"https://www.oneplus.com/6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OnePlus</a> started life out as an online-only smartphone brand, and has since gone on to launch a string of desirable devices, which has impressed the press and buyers alike. This has led to a major new announcement. For the OnePlus 6T, its next big smartphone launch, OnePlus devices will be sold in more carriers and retail stores in the United Kingdom.</p>",
            "<p>Network operators EE and Vodafone will both sell the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/oneplus-6t-news/\">OnePlus 6T</a>, alongside Carphone Warehouse, and larger high street retailer John Lewis. Mobile device distributer DataSelect will also sell the OnePlus 6T. It\u2019s not the first time a OnePlus phone will be available outside of OnePlus\u2019 own online store, and the new partners, in fact, join the O2 network, which already sells the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-6-review/\">OnePlus 6</a>, and has sold previous OnePlus phones too.</p>",
            "<p>There are two major reasons why this is big news. The first is more attention for OnePlus. Buying phones online isn\u2019t something most people do, and by physically having its phones alongside those from Apple, Samsung, Huawei, and others in a retail store means more attention. OnePlus makes compelling smartphones, and the more people who\u2019re introduced to them, the more who will consider buying them.</p>",
            "<p>The second reason is online sales can feel like a risk, even if there is a comprehensive returns program, because you can\u2019t touch, hold, and try the phone out ahead of handing over your money. With three networks and two major high street names all stocking the OnePlus 6T, the trepidatious have plenty of opportunity to try the device out for size. Removing these barriers is a major step forward for OnePlus.</p>",
            "<p>OnePlus has a strong reputation in the U.K. already, and according to the company itself, has been named as one of the top four premium smartphone brands. The OnePlus 6 sold a million devices in 22 days, and the company no doubt hopes to improve on those numbers with the OnePlus 6T, which will be announced on October 30 at an event in New York. It\u2019s the second OnePlus phone of 2018, and is expected to provide performance improvements, with some smart new features including an in-display fingerprint sensor.</p>",
            "<p>Read all the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/oneplus-6t-news/\">rumors about the OnePlus 6T here</a>, and look forward to our in-depth coverage of the new device from October 30 onwards.</p>"

            "<p>OnePlus has teamed up with automotive brand and F1 racing team McLaren to launch a collaborative smartphone. Its latest model, the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-6t-review/\">OnePlus 6T</a>, was just revealed in October, but OnePlus has partnered with brands, artists, and companies in the past to produce special limited edition versions of its smartphone. So what makes the <a href=\"https://www.oneplus.com/mclaren\">OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition</a> special? Here\u2019s what you need to know.</p>",
            "<p>The OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition will borrow heavily from the style of the OnePlus 6T, but there are some cosmetic differences between the two phones. The back of the McLaren Edition will emulate the look of McLaren\u2019s ground-breaking carbon fiber with a carbon fiber-style appearance. There\u2019s another nod to McLaren\u2019s heritage as well, with an orange line flowing along the bottom of the phone\u2019s rear. It\u2019s colored in Papaya Orange \u2014 McLaren\u2019s signature color. Right down at the base of the phone, you\u2019ll find McLaren\u2019s logo.</p>",
            "<p>Little has changed around the front, and you\u2019ll find the OnePlus 6T\u2019s huge bezel-less 6.41-inch AMOLED screen, and the distinctive teardrop notch. The in-display fingerprint scanner is here too, and buyers will get some unique wallpapers and a special start-up animation too.</p>",
            "<p>It wouldn\u2019t be a McLaren without some power and speed, right? The OnePlus 6T is no slouch in the power department, with the Snapdragon 845 and 8GB of RAM. OnePlus isn\u2019t able to top the Snapdragon 845 \u2026 yet. But it can boost performance by crammed in yet more RAM. The McLaren Edition sports a huge 10GB of RAM, meaning this phone should have no problem switching between apps or handling the most intensive of games.</p>",
            "<p>That\u2019s backed up by the huge hard drive, too. There\u2019s 256GB of storage crammed into the McLaren Edition, and though you won\u2019t find any MicroSD expansion, you\u2019re unlikely to need that much extra space anyway.</p>",
            "<p>There haven\u2019t been any major changes made to the camera in the OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition, so you can expect to find the same camera suite as <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-6t-review/\">the OnePlus 6T</a>. That means a primary 16-megapixel camera with an f/1.7 aperture and optical image stabilization, and a second 20-megapixel lens with the same aperture, plus another 16-megapixel lens around the front for selfies.</p>",
            "<p>Lamborghini\u2019s partnership with Oppo \u2014 a firm closely related to OnePlus \u2014 resulted in the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/oppo-find-x-lamborghini-edition-product-impressions/\">Lamborghini Edition of the Oppo Find X</a>, the first to feature Oppo\u2019s incredibly fast Super VOOC charging system, which takes a flat battery to 100 percent in less than 35 minutes. In a similar fashion, the OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition is packing a new version of Warp Charge: Warp Charge 30.</p>",
            "<p>Warp Charge 30 works in a similar way to Super VOOC charging, but it\u2019s even faster, promising to deliver a day\u2019s worth of power (around 50 percent) in just 20 minutes. That\u2019s possible because of the sheer power on display here \u2014 the charger the phone comes with packs a whopping 3oW of power, and that\u2019s managed with an intricate system of cooling that ensures the phone doesn\u2019t overheat during charging.</p>",
            "<p>The OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition will be available in the U.S. and Europe from December 13, from <a href=\"https://www.oneplus.com/mclaren\">OnePlus\u2019 website</a>. In line with OnePlus\u2019s own pricing structure, you won\u2019t have to pay a ridiculous amount for the phone \u2014 at $699 it\u2019s only a little more expensive than the highest spec OnePlus 6T.</p>",

            "<p>The notch is dead \u2014 long live the hole-punch display. Honor\u2019s View 20 is the forerunner of the new hole-punch movement, and it\u2019s a doozy of a phone, with a powerful Kirin 980 processor, a massive display, and some gorgeous good looks. But here be monsters, and the OnePlus 6T is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken\">kraken</a> of the midrange phone market, with power, looks, and features far beyond its sub-$600 price tag. Can the Honor View 20 take down the beast and claim a place in the pantheon of <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-smartphones/\">the best phones of 2019</a>? We took a look to find out.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll find two top-notch \u201cflagchips\u201d going head-to-head here, and there\u2019s little to part the OnePlus 6T\u2019s Snapdragon 845 and the View 20\u2019s Kirin 980 in benchmarks and real-life performance. Both of these offer tip-top smoothness and powerful gaming performance. Both pack roomy storage, with 128GB and 256GB storage options, as well as models with 6GB and 8GB of RAM.</p>",
            "<p>But what of battery life? The View 20 has an edge over the OnePlus 6T with a battery that\u2019s 300mAh larger, but the excellent software means you\u2019re likely to see two days of battery life on the View 20. The 6T is no slouch there either though, managing a day-and-a-half on a single charge \u2014 but the View 20 is clearly superior. There\u2019s no wireless charging on either phone, but both come with super-fast charging that\u2019ll refill your battery in no time at all.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s a close-run competition, but the View 20\u2019s larger battery life wins it the round.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Honor View 20<br>\n</strong></p>",
            "<p>Borders are well and truly gone, and both of these phones boast exceptional bezel-free designs. Modern style is prevalent here, and so we find glass builds, sleek looks, and subtle refractions built into the back panels \u2014 the \u201cS\u201d on the 6T and the reflective \u201cV\u201d on the View 20. Glass means both phones are susceptible to damage, and neither come with water-resistance, which is a real shame.</p>",
            "<p>However, the really big difference between the two looks like it\u2019ll be a 2018 versus 2019 issue \u2014 the hole punch versus the notch. The 6T\u2019s teardrop notch is subtle for a notch, but the hole punch almost seems to disappear during normal use. We think it\u2019s a big enough difference to give an edge to the View 20.</p>",
            "<p>There\u2019s a clear winner here, but it\u2019s important to note that both phones are gorgeous, and you won\u2019t be disappointed with either. However, the hole punch is superior to the notch \u2014 even a discreet notch like the 6T\u2019s. The Honor View 20 wins.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Honor View 20<br>\n</strong></p>",
            "<p>Much like bezels, it seems <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-smallest-smartphones/\">small phones</a> have had their day. Both the View 20 and the 6T are enormous, with screens that exceed 6 inches in size. The View 10\u2019s 6.4-inch LCD display runs a 2310 x 1080-pixel resolution, and it\u2019s good, with plenty of user customization available. However, it pales next to the OnePlus 6T\u2019s 6.41-inch AMOLED display. While it runs a similar 2340 x 1080-pixel resolution, the AMOLED screen tech means crisper contrast, blacker blacks, and more vibrant colors. It\u2019s simply the better screen.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: OnePlus 6T<br>\n</strong></p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll find a 16-megapixel and a 20-megapixel lens on the back of the OnePlus 6T, backed up by a 16-megapixel lens around the front. It\u2019s probably the best camera suite we\u2019ve seen from OnePlus so far, and it takes some great photos. The portrait mode edge detection is particularly worthy of note. The OnePlus 6T\u2019s camera suite also includes a 2x telephoto zoom lens, and slow motion at 480 frames per second.</p>",
            "<p>But is it good enough to beat the View 20? Bucking Honor\u2019s usual trend, the View 20 only packs a single lens. But it\u2019s a monster \u2014 48-megapixels, and backed up by a 3D Time-of-Flight sensor. The front-facing lens is a similarly monstrous 25-megapixel beast. Normally, we don\u2019t put much stock in numbers, but the View 20 walks the walk, and produces some excellent shots in a variety of circumstances. While not on the level of the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-review/\">Pixel 3</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/huawei-mate-20-pro-review/\">Mate 20 Pro</a>, we feel it\u2019s almost there \u2014 and that\u2019s a shocking thing to admit in a phone this price. The View 20 also comes with twice the amount of slo-mo at 960 frames per second.</p>",
            "<p>While the OnePlus 6T has a great camera suite, the View 20 has kicked Honor off to a great start in 2019.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Honor View 20<br>\n</strong></p>",
            "<p><a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-android-p-news/\">Android 9.0 Pie</a> is a beautiful thing, and you\u2019ll find it on both phones \u2014 though you might not initially realize it. OnePlus\u2019 Oxygen OS is the closest to a stock Android, being rather similar to the version of Android we see on Pixels. That\u2019s very much a good thing, and it\u2019s customizable too. There\u2019s even the option to use <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-use-android-9-pie-gesture-navigation/\">Android\u2019s new swiping-based gesture navigation</a>. The View 20 has Honor\u2019s own Magic UI 2, and it\u2019s a heavily customized version of Android based on Huawei\u2019s EMUI software. If you\u2019re not used it, prepare yourself; this isn\u2019t anywhere close to a normal Android experience. But it still has its charms, and we\u2019ve grown to enjoy it.</p>",
            "<p>The update situation is a little more lop-sided. OnePlus has always been fairly <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/android-p-when-do-you-get-it/\">snappy with updates</a>, while Honor traditionally puts out updates a little bit later \u2014 mostly due to the work needed to build the heavily customized skin. Will that change with the new Magic UI 2? Maybe, but for now, OnePlus has the faster update speed and a slimmer Android interface, and that counts for a lot.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: OnePlus 6T<br>\n</strong></p>",
            "<p>Budgets have to be cut somewhere with midrange phones, and with top specs and designs, there\u2019s not much room for many special features. However, there\u2019s still some stuff here to be excited about. Both phones have a gaming mode that strips away distracting notifications and boosts gaming performance and network speed, and both phones have facial unlocking options. The OnePlus 6T\u2019s in-display fingerprint scanner may be enough to wow some, but we found it a little unreliable in practice, even if the tech is really cool in itself. Speaking of other slight disappointments, despite AptX HD support, sound on the Honor View 20 failed to match our expectations.</p>",
            "<p>This category is a hard one to crack, but we\u2019re giving it to the OnePus 6T, simply because the in-display fingerprint scanner is so cool.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: OnePlus 6T<br>\n</strong></p>",
            "<p>The OnePlus 6T is currently available, with prices starting from $549. You can get it directly from <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=10855&amp;awinaffid=291795&amp;clickref=&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2F6t%2F\">OnePlus</a>, or pick it up from <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/oneplus-6t\" rel=\"noopener\">T-Mobile</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-A6003-Dual-SIM-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B07CHQHFDZ/?tag=dt-incontent-btn-20\" www.>Amazon</a>. It will only work with GSM networks like T-Mobile and AT&amp;T.</p>",
            "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.hihonor.com/global/products/smartphone/honorview20/?fromBanner=home_content_HONOR_View20/\">Honor View 20</a> starts from 500 British pounds (currently around $650), though it\u2019s worth noting that the OnePlus 6T also starts from 500 British pounds in the U.K. It\u2019s unclear whether the Honor View 20 will be officially released in the U.S., but if you import it we expect it will only work fully with T-Mobile and AT&amp;T.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s a close run competition, but for our money, the Honor View 20 pulls ahead of the OnePlus 6T with a strong battery, a design that\u2019s very 2019, and a pretty amazing camera. But that doesn\u2019t mean the OnePlus 6T is without its charms \u2014 it\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s powerful, and it\u2019s a bargain. But the Honor View 20 is just stronger at this point. We imagine the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/oneplus-7-news/\">OnePlus 7</a> will put up a good fight though, and we\u2019ll be sure to pit the View 20 against OnePlus\u2019s latest when it arrives.</p>"

            "<p>The self-proclaimed \u201cflagship killer\u201d has come a long way over the last few years, with an aggressive policy of turning out new smartphones every six months. OnePlus has consistently offered close-to-cutting-edge specs at knockout prices that undercut the competition.</p>",
            "<p>It looks as though the OnePlus 6T is the best phone the company has ever turned out, but how does it measure up to its predecessors? We decided to pit it against the last three OnePlus releases to see precisely what has changed and to help you decide whether it\u2019s time to pull the trigger on an upgrade.</p>",
            "<p>If you\u2019re looking for an area of compromise where OnePlus scrimps to keep its costs down, you won\u2019t find it in the performance department. The OnePlus 6T and OnePlus 6 both have the virtually ubiquitous Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor inside, which you\u2019ll also find in everything from <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review/\">Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 9</a> to <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-review/\">Google\u2019s Pixel 3</a>. The older OnePlus 5T and 5 have the previous year\u2019s Snapdragon 835, which is slightly slower and less power efficient.</p>",
            "<p>All of them come with 6GB or 8GB of RAM, which <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-much-ram-does-a-smartphone-need/\">may be overkill</a> unless you\u2019re a major multitasker.\u00a0Storage has been upped from 64GB or 128GB to 128GB or 256GB in the newest phone. OnePlus is not keen on the humble MicroSD card slot, so you won\u2019t find one in any of these phones.</p>",
            "<p>The 3,300mAh battery found in the OnePlus 5, 5T, and 6 has finally been upgraded in the 6T to 3,700mAh. Even accounting for the larger display, that should provide a boost to stamina. All of these phones support fast charging, but you won\u2019t find any Qi wireless charging support.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: OnePlus 6T</strong></p>",
            "<p>We think this is a category where you can see the clearest evolution of the OnePlus range. We felt the OnePlus 5 was aping the iPhone a little too closely, but the fingerprint sensor moved around back in the 5T. The OnePlus 6 did adopt the notch, but it was smaller than the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-x-review/\">iPhone X\u2019s</a> and the central camera module and fingerprint sensor on the back gave it a feel of its own. The OnePlus 6T is perhaps its most distinct phone yet, with that teardrop notch, the slimmest of bottom bezels, and an in-display fingerprint sensor. It\u2019s a refined, attractive design that\u2019s going to turn heads.</p>",
            "<p>Water resistance is an area where OnePlus has cut corners. While most flagship smartphones nowadays can be submerged without damage, there\u2019s no <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-rugged-is-your-phone/\">IP-rating</a> for any of these OnePlus phones. The OnePlus 5T and OnePlus 5 both had aluminum frames and backs, but the newer duo are glass front and back, so durability is definitely an issue here. It should be noted the OnePlus 6T is wrapped in Gorilla Glass 6, which is the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/corning-gorilla-glass-6-news/\">most durable version from Corning yet</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Something that\u2019s sure to disappoint some people is the lack of a traditional headphone port in the OnePlus 6T, especially since all the other phones here have a standard 3.5mm audio jack.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: OnePlus 6T</strong></p>",
            "<p>The shift in the display from the OnePlus 5 through to the OnePlus 6T mirrors wider industry trends. We\u2019ve gone from a 5.5-inch display with a 16:9 aspect ratio to a 6.4-inch display with an 19.5:9 ratio, which has prompted a resolution shift from 1,920 x 1,080 pixels to 2,340 x 1,080 pixels. Interestingly, all these phones have essentially the same pixel density and they\u2019re all AMOLED screens. The extra size isn\u2019t the only benefit of the OnePlus 6T\u2019s display though, it\u2019s also brighter, with better color accuracy and more software tuning options than its predecessors.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: OnePlus 6T</strong></p>",
            "<p>On paper, it looks like these phones all have the same exact camera setup, a dual-lens 16-megapixel and 20-megapixel main camera and a 16-megapixel front-facing camera. There have actually been a few jumps in the hardware quality, with newer sensors, and lots of developments on the software and tuning side that mean you can <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/oneplus-6-oneplus-5t-oneplus-5-oneplus-3t-camera-shootout/\">see concrete improvements</a>. The camera in the OnePlus 6 is definitely better than the cameras in the 5 and 5T. The OnePlus 6T also features some new artificial smarts for scene recognition and improved portrait and low-light capabilities, but we\u2019ve yet to test it against the OnePlus 6, so we\u2019re not yet sure if there\u2019s any discernible jump in quality.</p>",
            "<p>Only the 6 and 6T have super slow motion video support.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winners: OnePlus 6 and 6T</strong></p>",
            "<p>With <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/android-9-pie-review/\">Android 9.0 Pie</a> out of the box, the OnePlus 6T has a clear advantage. The OnePlus 5 and 5T can both be upgraded to Android 8.1 Oreo, which is what the OnePlus 6 launched with, and they will eventually get the update to Android Pie. The OnePlus 6 has received the Android 9.0 Pie update already. All of them have OxygenOS on top, which offers various customization options and shortcuts that you won\u2019t find in stock Android. We expect the 6T and 6 to have a similar shelf life in terms of updates, so there\u2019s no dividing them here.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winners: OnePlus 6 and 6T</strong></p>",
            "<p>The in-display fingerprint sensor enabled OnePlus to hit new heights with its design in the 6T, but most of the other special features are nothing new for the range. As mentioned, OxyegnOS offers lots of gesture shortcuts and customization options, and there\u2019s also a special gaming mode to prevent interruptions and ensure your gaming sessions are as smooth as possible.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: OnePlus 6T</strong></p>",
            "<p>Price has always been a major selling point for the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/go/6cfa98ff938c3cd1175de0233aa9850c88d91bb5/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" class=\" h-affiliate-link trackable\" data-event-type=\"affiliate-click\" data-event-action=\"manual\" data-event-param=\"OnePlus\">OnePlus</a> range, but it has been creeping higher with each new phone. We\u2019ve gone from $480 for the basic model of the OnePlus 5 up to $550 for the OnePlus 6T, but that\u2019s still great value compared to other flagships on the market. OnePlus also discontinues its older phones as soon as the new ones are released, so there\u2019s no option to go back and buy an older model unless you can find some remaining stock from another seller.</p>",
            "<p>The OnePlus 6T is also available now from T-Mobile, giving you another place to buy it from. It\u2019s also compatible on Verizon \u2014 a first for OnePlus \u2014 making it the most accessible OnePlus phone ever.</p>",
            "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/go/6cfa98ff938c3cd1175de0233aa9850c88d91bb5/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" class=\" h-affiliate-link trackable\" data-event-type=\"affiliate-click\" data-event-action=\"manual\" data-event-param=\"OnePlus\">OnePlus 6T</a> is the best phone that OnePlus has made so far, but it\u2019s very, very similar to the OnePlus 6. We\u2019re talking about some extra battery capacity, a better design, and a slightly bigger display. If you already have the OnePlus 6, then you should hold onto it for a while. For people with the OnePlus 5T or OnePlus 5, the 6T is going to be a more tempting upgrade, and you can add faster performance and a better camera to the list of temptations.</p>"

            "<p>Amazing tech isn\u2019t the killer feature of the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-6t-review/\">brand new OnePlus 6T</a>, such as the in-display fingerprint sensor or the new Gorilla Glass 6 protection, which should survive multiple bumbles and fumbles. Neither are this fantastic smartphone\u2019s drool-worthy good looks, nor a price tag that will make you do a double take, the real breakthrough here.</p>",
            "<p>No, that would be a partnership OnePlus announced with T-Mobile, as well as support for Verizon\u2019s network \u2013 both of which make the OnePlus 6T the most accessible phone for U.S. consumers ever for the company. That\u2019s a big deal, because it means the brand can finally stream through the public consciousness. Yes, within the tech world, OnePlus has become an established, reputable brand in a relatively short period of time. But ask most Americans if they\u2019ve heard about it and you\u2019ll see shrugs.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s something we\u2019ve asked OnePlus almost every time the company has launched a phone: When will you get a U.S. carrier on board?</p>",
            "<p>OnePlus smartphones have previously supported only the GSM network, which meant they were compatible with AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, and not Verizon or Sprint. Even then, you couldn\u2019t go to a store to see these phones in action; the company has never sold them through a carrier, just <a href=\"https://www.oneplus.com/\">on its site</a>.</p>",
            "<p>You need carrier support to break through the duopoly that is Samsung and Apple, especially because most Americans buy their phones this way or through retail stores.</p>",
            "<p>\u201cBrick and mortar stores will still be one of the main channels for smartphone sales,\u201d Jeff Fieldhack said in <a href=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/online-smartphone-sales-remain-strong-at-13-of-total-us-sales-prime-exclusives-by-amazon-drive-sales/\">a Counterpoint Research report</a> on smartphone sales in the second quarter of 2018. \u201cPhysically touching and testing high-end devices is still important for the consumer as flagship [average selling prices] continue to climb. \u2026 While Amazon is doing well, carriers still have the upper hand. Online sales will continue to grab small amounts of market share, but it will not spike outside of key flagship launches, holidays, and special online sale days.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>OnePlus is putting its latest phone into 5,600 T-Mobile stores around the country. And the T-Mob won\u2019t just be displaying and advertising the phone; it\u2019s also offering to shave $300 off the price if you trade-in a select device (the supported list is long), bringing an already affordable flagship phone to a truly unbeatable price.</p>",
            "<p>Better yet, T-Mobile is offering financing so you can pay the phone off in easy, monthly payments. (The only trade off with the T-Mobile deal? It\u2019s for the mirror gloss variant with 8GB RAM and 128GB of storage, and it lacks dual-SIM support.)</p>",
            "<p>Then there\u2019s Verizon support. Verizon has more than 150 million subscribers in the U.S., allowing OnePlus to reach millions more it couldn\u2019t before \u2014 and grow from there. The OnePlus 6T will still need to be bought from OnePlus\u2019 site, but it\u2019s not a barrier anymore as you can simply throw in a Verizon SIM card for cellular service to kick in. The phone supports Verizon\u2019s LTE band, including support for VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling.</p>",
            "<p>Increased carrier support means more people will be conscious of the brand, and the T-Mobile partnership will allow those interested to try the phones in stores before they buy. This doesn\u2019t just impact the U.S., as OnePlus has added more carriers around the world. It now supports 233 carriers in 74 countries. In the U.K., the phone will be available in EE and Vodafone stores alongside the O2 network.</p>",
            "<p>This also couldn\u2019t be a more perfect time for OnePlus. Smartphone prices are rising. Even the OnePlus 6T costs a little more than <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-6-review/\">the OnePlus 6</a>, but it\u2019s still a fraction of what you\u2019d pay for an <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-xs-review/\">iPhone XS</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review/\">Galaxy Note 9</a>. U.S. consumers hold onto their phones for an average of 2.83 years before they decide to upgrade, according to HYLA Mobile Inc., reported by the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/upgrade-no-thanks-americans-are-sticking-with-their-old-phones-1540818000\">Wall Street Journal</a>, and it\u2019s partly due to rising prices. Wider network support means OnePlus can show consumers they do not need to pay upwards of $700 for a good phone.</p>",
            "<p>In our review, we described the OnePlus 6T as \u201ceverything you want at half the price,\u201d and it\u2019s true. You get the same processor that powers the Galaxy Note 9; there\u2019s a big battery that will easily get you through a full day; and the 6.4-inch screen covers almost the entire front of the phone. The downsides are it only has a decent camera, there\u2019s no headphone jack, no proper water resistance, and the new under-glass fingerprint sensor isn\u2019t as reliable. These are minor problems, though \u2026 because everything else about the OnePlus 6T makes this one of the best value phones you can buy right now.</p>"

Unfortunately, Moment only supports a fairly small range of smartphones, so you need to have the right device to take advantage. Thankfully, you can add two more phones to that pile, as Moment has just announced it will be stocking cases and lenses for the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-6-review/\">OnePlus 6</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-6t-review/\">OnePlus 6T</a>.</p>",

The kicker is that since much of the equipment is attached to a phone via a protective case, it\u2019s not really possible to use Moment\u2019s kit with a phone it hasn\u2019t specifically supported. Those lucky OnePlus fans are about to be included in that exclusive club, with the release of <a href=\"https://www.shopmoment.com/one-plus-6-moment-lenses-and-cases\">Moment cases for the OnePlus 6</a>. Moment has also taken the opportunity to upgrade its cases, adding more protection against drops, an improved and strengthened lens interface, and increased coverage at the bottom of the case.</p>",
            "<p>Cases for the OnePlus 6 will be available in black canvas and walnut wood from December 11, at the price of $30. If you\u2019re rocking the OnePlus 6T, you\u2019ll have to wait a little longer, as cases are not shipping until February 2019, but you\u2019ll still be able to find them in black canvas and walnut wood, and for $30. However, if you\u2019re quick off the mark, you can get 15 percent off all OnePlus cases for the first 24 hours with the code \u201cOnePlus6.\u201d</p>",

            "<p>Spigen\u2019s a name you can rely on for great everyday protection, and we think the Liquid Air is a good choice if you\u2019re looking for stylish protection that won\u2019t let you down.

However, customizability is the name of the game, and you can choose a variety of leathers for your case, up to the expensive aged Patine leather. If that wasn\u2019t enough, you can also choose from a bunch of colors, a belt clip, and even add a personal logo or picture \u2014 though it\u2019ll skyrocket in price if you go for all of them.

            "<p>While OnePlus has developed quite a cult following in the U.S. over the past few years, its newest phone, the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-6t-review/\">OnePlus 6T</a>, is about to introduce the smartphone manufacturer to a whole new audience. In addition to sporting some awesome hardware, the OnePlus 6T is <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/oneplus-6t-secret-weapon/\">now available in T-Mobile stores</a>\u00a0and finally works on Verizon\u2019s network.</p>",
            "<p>Whether you\u2019re new to OnePlus or you have been a fan for years, the OnePlus 6T <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/oneplus-6t-news/\">has some features</a> you may not be familiar with. We compiled a list of some of our favorite tips and tricks to get you started with your new phone. We also have <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/oneplus-6t-setings/\">a separate guide on key settings</a> you will want to tweak as you set up the phone.</p>",
            "<p>Need to take a break from your smartphone? It may be a good idea to schedule some downtime with the Do Not Disturb feature on the OnePlus 6T.</p>",
            "<p>If you want to set up a Do Not Disturb schedule, go to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Sound &gt; Do Not Disturb &gt; Turn On Automatically.\u00a0</em>Tap\u00a0<em>Sleeping\u00a0</em>to set up a nightly Do Not Disturb schedule. If you would rather have Do Not Disturb kick in during meetings or certain events, tap the\u00a0<em>Event\u00a0</em>option. \u00a0To set up a custom rule select <em>Add Rule. </em>When you\u2019ve finished configuring your selected option, make sure you toggle the slider next to\u00a0<em>Use Rule.\u00a0</em></p>",
            "<p>Like it or not, the smartphone notch is here to stay. In comparison to some phones like the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-review/\">Google Pixel 3</a>, the notch on the OnePlus 6T is downright dainty. If a display notch is an absolute nonstarter for you, however, there\u2019s an easy way to hide it on the OnePlus 6T.</p>",
            "<p>To hide the notch, just head over to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Display &gt; Notch Display.\u00a0</em>Tap the button next to\u00a0<em>Hide the Notch Area.\u00a0</em></p>",
            "<p>Reading Mode is one of our favorite features in OxygenOS. With Reading Mode, you can easily emulate an ebook reader screen on your OnePlus 6T. OxygenOS allows you to select apps to automatically open in Reading Mode.</p>",
            "<p>Ready to set up Reading Mode? Go to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Display &gt; Reading Mode.\u00a0</em>Select\u00a0<em>Add Apps For Reading Mode\u00a0</em>and select the apps you\u2019d like to use.\u00a0You can also toggle the slider next to\u00a0<em>Block Peek Notifications\u00a0</em>if you don\u2019t want to be disturbed while using Reading Mode.</p>",
            "<p>The high-end specs on the OnePlus 6T make it an excellent smartphone option for mobile gamers. In addition to strong specifications, there is a Gaming Mode that helps minimize notifications and prioritize mobile data when playing your favorite games.</p>",
            "<p>To set up Gaming Mode, go to\u00a0<i>Settings &gt; Utilities &gt; Gaming Mode.\u00a0</i>At the bottom of the screen press\u00a0<em>Add Apps For Gaming Mode</em> and select the apps you would like to include. Press the back arrow and toggle the sliders next to the settings you would like to change when gaming.</p>",
            "<p>Though it has been out for months, very few phones have <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/android-9-pie-review/\">Android 9.0 Pie</a>. The OnePlus 6T is a member of that exclusive club. While that means the entire OS is up to date, it also means you\u2019ll see Android\u2019s clunky new navigation system in action. That is unless you switch to the far superior OnePlus navigation gestures that are baked in the latest version of OxygenOS.</p>",
            "<p>If you want to make the switch to the new gesture system, go to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Buttons &amp; Gestures &gt; Navigation Bar &amp; Gestures.\u00a0</em>Tap the button next to <i>Navigation Gestures. </i>Swipe up from the bottom of the display to return to the home screen.</p>",
            "<p>Similar to the iPhone\u2019s mute switch, there is an Alert Slider on the OnePlus 6T. This slider allows you to quickly turn off notifications on the phone. But did you know you can change the Alert Slider settings to better fit your needs?</p>",
            "<p>You can customize the Alert Slider by going to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Buttons &amp; Gestures &gt; Alert Slider.\u00a0</em>Tap\u00a0<em>Silent\u00a0</em>and toggle the <em>Media\u00a0</em>slider\u00a0if you would like to limit the mode to ringtones and notifications only.\u00a0Tap\u00a0<em>Ring </em>and toggle the\u00a0<em>Also Vibrate For Calls\u00a0</em>slider if you\u2019d like to stop the phone from vibrating when it rings.</p>",
            "<p>Sure the in-display fingerprint sensor is awesome, but it\u2019s a little finicky. If you\u2019re having problems authenticating with the sensor, you may be able to do something about it. Right now the best workaround seems to be creating a second instance of your fingerprint to improve overall accuracy.</p>",
            "<p>When you\u2019re ready to add a second copy of your fingerprint on the OnePlus 6T, go to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Security &amp; Lock Screen Fingerprint.\u00a0</em>Enter your PIN or pattern to authenticate. Tap the\u00a0<em>Add Fingerprint\u00a0</em>option and re-register the finger you already use to unlock your phone.</p>",
            "<p>While it\u2019s easy to secure documents and other information on your computer, things are a little more tricky on a smartphone. Luckily, the OnePlus 6T has a feature called App Locker that allows you to hide your sensitive information from prying eyes. With App Locker, users are required to authenticate with a PIN, Pattern, or fingerprint before opening selected apps.</p>",
            "<p>If you\u2019re ready to set up App Locker, go to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Utilities &gt; App Locker.\u00a0</em>Enter your PIN or Pattern. Press\u00a0<em>Add Apps\u00a0</em>to select the apps you\u2019d like to protect with App Locker.</p>",
            "<p>Have multiple accounts with a certain app or service? Like to use them easily without having to log in and out of accounts? If so, you\u2019ll love Parallel Apps. This feature allows you to create multiple instances that run independently on the OnePlus 6T.</p>",
            "<p>To set up Parallel Apps, make sure you have the apps you\u2019d like to duplicate installed and go to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Utilities &gt; Parallel Apps.\u00a0</em>A list of compatible apps will appear. Toggle on each app you would like to duplicate on the home screen or in the app drawer.</p>"

            "<p>With the recent release of the iPhone XR, Apple\u2019s yearly iPhone releases are done and dusted \u2014 and despite being billed as the lesser option to the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-xs-review/\">iPhone XS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-xs-max-review/\">XS Max</a>, we love the lower-cost <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-xr-review/\">iPhone XR</a>. With all the same power, but a more vibrant design, we think it might be the best iPhone of the year.</p>",
            "<p>But there\u2019s more than just iPhones out there. The new <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-6t-review/\">OnePlus 6T</a> provides flagship power and a beautiful design for less than the usual flagship price. Does the iPhone XR have what it takes to defeat Android\u2019s flagship killer, or will OnePlus add another scalp to its collection? We found out.</p>",
            "<p>As befits a flagship, you\u2019ll find powerful processors powering each of these phones. The OnePlus 6T is equipped with this year\u2019s \u201cflagchip\u201d, the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/qualcomm-snapdragon-845/\">Snapdragon 845</a>, and it provides smooth performance and plenty of grunt for tackling the latest mobile games. However, it\u2019s not as powerful as Apple\u2019s A12 Bionic chip, which powers the iPhone XR, not to mention the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-xs-review/\">iPhone XS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-xs-max-review/\">XS Max</a>. Despite having less RAM than the OnePlus 6T, the XR easily handled every game we threw at it \u2014 which included some <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-apple-arkit-apps/\">ARKit 2.0</a> apps. You also get plenty of storage on both phones \u2014 but there\u2019s no MicroSD card expansion option for either.</p>",
            "<p>On paper you\u2019d expect the OnePlus 6T\u2019s 3,700mAh battery to easily beat the iPhone XR\u2019s 2,942mAh battery \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t play out that way. Both phones are more than capable of over a day\u2019s worth of power and beyond, though the OnePlus 6T may have slightly more stamina. The iPhone XR also comes with wireless charging, but you <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-fast-charge-your-iphone/\">won\u2019t be fast charging</a> with the cable in the box \u2014 while the 6T comes with OnePlus\u2019s super-fast Dash charging.</p>",
            "<p>You won\u2019t be unhappy with the performance, battery life, or charging offered by either of these phones \u2014 but the iPhone XR\u2019s A12 Bionic processor means it\u2019s the more powerful of the two.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Apple iPhone XR<br>\n</strong></p>",
            "<p>This is a much tighter category to judge than the previous one \u2014 both are stunning smartphones that are sure to turn heads. The OnePlus 6T takes everything we loved about the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-6-review/\">OnePlus 6</a> and ramps it up, reducing the notch to a dewdrop design, and putting the fingerprint scanner beneath the display. On the other hand, the iPhone XR is a combination of the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-8-review/\">iPhone 8</a>\u2018s back with the iPhone XS\u2019s front, and it\u2019s a beautiful design \u2014 and did we mention we can\u2019t get enough of those colors?</p>",
            "<p>So both get full marks for design \u2014 but what about durability? Both use fragile glass in their build, so you\u2019ll find similar durability \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-oneplus-6t-cases/\">a protective case</a> is definitely a good idea. You\u2019ll only find water-resistance on the iPhone XR, however, which comes with an IP67-rating. The OnePlus 6T lacks any certified water-resistance \u2014 which means you\u2019ll need to keep it tightly held around pools.</p>",
            "<p>Both of these phones are neck-and-neck in design, so pulling ahead on water-resistance makes the iPhone XR the narrow winner.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Apple iPhone XR<br>\n</strong></p>",
            "<p>The iPhone XR marks the d\u00e9but of Apple\u2019s newest display tech. Named \u201cLiquid Retina\u201d, it\u2019s an LCD display that\u2019s able to be curved \u2014 meaning it\u2019s able to curve into a phone\u2019s body without the need to incorporate a large chin. It\u2019s a great tech, and it looks good. However, it is only running a 1792 x 828 resolution. Not only is the OnePlus 6T rocking a 2340 x 1080 resolution \u2014 making it sharper than the XR \u2014 but it\u2019s also a superior AMOLED panel. It shows deep, inky blacks and vibrant colors the iPhone can only dream of \u2014 and it\u2019s the clear winner here.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: OnePlus 6T<br>\n</strong></p>",
            "<p>There hasn\u2019t been a huge shake-up in camera lenses on the OnePlus 6T, and you\u2019ll find the same 16-megapixel and 20-megapixel lenses as the OnePlus 6. OnePlus has improved the software though, and it\u2019s capable of more than before, including a low-light Nightscape mode, and smoother edge-detection in portrait mode shots. It\u2019s easily the best camera OnePlus has ever released, and it takes some great photos. However, it falls short of matching greats like the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-review/\">Pixel 3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review/\">Note 9</a>, and iPhone XS.</p>",
            "<p>The iPhone XR, on the other hand, comes with just a single rear-facing lens \u2014 a 12-megapixel lens that\u2019s identical to the iPhone XS\u2019s primary lens. It\u2019s capable of the same Smart HDR as the new iPhones, and also takes some great portrait mode shots \u2014 though it\u2019s restricted to only taking portrait mode shots of people. Some versatility is lost without the 2x zoom lens, but it\u2019s not detrimental to its overall performance, and the XR takes some great shots in a variety of lighting.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll be able to capture 4K video on both of these phones, but you\u2019ll only get slow-motion fun on the OnePlus 6T. Selfies from either are likely to be good, but the iPhone\u2019s TrueDepth selfie camera provides excellent portrait mode shots \u2014 and is the superior again.</p>",
            "<p>While the 6T is the best camera OnePlus has produced to date, the iPhone XR\u2019s camera suite is just better.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Apple iPhone XR<br>\n</strong></p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll find the latest version of Android, <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-android-p-news/\">Android 9.0 Pie</a>, on the OnePlus 6T, hidden by Oxygen OS. It\u2019s fairly similar to <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/what-is-stock-android/\">stock Android</a>, and we really enjoyed our time using it. In terms of updates, OnePlus is usually pretty snappy <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/android-p-when-do-you-get-it/\">getting major Android updates out</a>, so you shouldn\u2019t be too disappointed with your update speed to <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/possible-android-q-names/\">Android Q</a>, or even Android R.</p>",
            "<p>The iPhone is always going to update faster though, and that\u2019s simply because Apple has a direct line to its phones. The iPhone XR comes with the latest <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/ios-12-review/\">iOS 12</a>, and we really dig it. It\u2019s a great piece of software, and while some Android heads will never like it, iPhone fans will love it.</p>",
            "<p><a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/android-vs-ios/\">Comparing Android and iOS</a> is always like comparing apples and oranges \u2014 you probably know your favorite by now. We\u2019re going to rule this a tie.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Tie<br>\n</strong></p>",
            "<p>The aforementioned TrueDepth camera on the iPhone XR provides most of the fun special features, allowing for face-unlocking via <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-set-up-an-alternate-appearance-for-face-id/\">Face ID</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-make-a-memoji/\">support for Animojis</a>. iOS 12 brings gesture navigation with it, which is probably our favorite implementation of <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/ios-12-on-iphone-xs-xs-max-and-xr/\">gesture navigation</a> so far. The XR doesn\u2019t have 3D Touch support like the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-iphone-xs-vs-iphone-xs-max-vs-iphone-xr/\">rest of this year\u2019s iPhones though</a>, but it does have the more limited Haptic Touch instead.</p>",
            "<p>The OnePlus 6T has a larger set of special features to avail yourself of. There\u2019s now a gaming mode that prioritizes network traffic and performance, as well as OnePlus\u2019s own spin on gesture navigation. The aforementioned in-display fingerprint scanner is cool \u2014 even if it isn\u2019t perfect \u2014 and the display also includes night-time and reading modes for eye comfort.</p>",
            "<p>While Apple\u2019s special features are all polished and near-perfect, the OnePlus 6T simply has more to play with, and it comes with some stuff we find really cool \u2014 like the in-display fingerprint scanner.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: OnePlus 6T<br>\n</strong></p>",
            "<p>The OnePlus 6T costs from $549, and works on T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, and Verizon. The iPhone XR is also available now, and it\u2019s the cheapest iPhone this year \u2014 but that\u2019s relative. Prices <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-iphone-xs-xs-max-xr-availability/\">start at $750</a>, but it will work with every major U.S. network.</p>",
            "<p>It was tight battle, but the writing was on the wall by the later categories. The iPhone XR is more powerful, comes with a better camera, and gets a slight edge thanks to its water-resistance. But by no means does that mean the OnePlus 6T is a bad phone. The Snapdragon 845 may not be as powerful as the A12 Bionic, but it\u2019s still capable of handling anything you can throw at it. The 6T\u2019s cameras are also very capable \u2014 and we really don\u2019t have to defend the drop-dead gorgeous design.</p>",
            "<p>But at the end of the day, the iPhone XR is simply the stronger phone across our categories. Grab it and you won\u2019t be disappointed with its performance \u2014 but if you prefer Android, or the lower price tag, you\u2019ll also be served extremely well by the OnePlus 6T.</p>"

            "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/oneplus-mclaren-f1-news/\">OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition</a> isn\u2019t a superficial collaboration. While it shares a similar design and almost the same specifications as the standard <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-6t-review/\">OnePlus 6T</a>, there are meaningful enhancements that not only make this powerful phone look gorgeous, but also offer improvements you\u2019ll notice every day. If owning the OnePlus 6T has crossed your mind over the past few weeks, here\u2019s why the McLaren Edition is worth considering.</p>",
            "<p>There are five main differences between the standard OnePlus 6T and the McLaren Edition. First, you\u2019re getting a box with a few other goodies, including a booklet commemorating OnePlus and McLaren; a plaque celebrating the McLaren Edition phone; a case; and a note from OnePlus CEO Pete Lau.</p>",
            "<p>The McLaren Edition also gets more storage than the base version of the OnePlus 6T \u2014 256GB to be exact. Only the Midnight Black OnePlus 6T color comes with an option for that much storage. Even more unique is the whopping 10GB of RAM. That means it should be able to handle all the multi-tasking you can throw at it, but more on that later.</p>",
            "<p>While it\u2019s the same design as the standard OnePlus 6T, the McLaren Edition adds the iconic Papaya Orange color scheme to the edges of the phone. And finally, you get a faster charging system called Warp Charge 30. OnePlus\u2019 charging technology is one of the fastest available, and it used to be called \u201cDash Charge.\u201d This year, the company <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/oneplus-rename-dash-charge-to-warp-charge/\">faced some legal and trademark woes</a> surrounding the branding of its charging technology, which is why the name has changed to Warp Charge.</p>",
            "<p>Warp Charge 30 on the McLaren Edition isn\u2019t the same as Dash Charge on the OnePlus 6T. OnePlus specifically claims Warp Charge 30 delivers 50 percent recharge in just 20 minutes, which is faster than what we\u2019ve previously seen from the company. This is all thanks to fresh battery design and an improved charging adapter. The cable you get is braided too, and both it and the adapter are the same Papaya Orange color to match the McLaren-themed phone.</p>",
            "<p>The OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition doesn\u2019t look ostentatious. The glass on the back is glossy, but underneath in the center is a carbon fiber-like weave. It\u2019s subtle, and you\u2019ll need to shine it in the light to really see it. Similarly, the Papaya Orange accents around the bottom edges of the phone can be easy to miss at a first glance. It shimmers when caught in the light, and when this happens it looks beautifully elegant.</p>",
            "<p>The McLaren logo sits at the bottom on the back, and that\u2019s about it in terms of design changes between the McLaren Edition and the standard OnePlus 6T. The front is exactly the same, with the in-display fingerprint sensor and teardrop notch.</p>",
            "<p>Turn the phone on and you\u2019ll notice the McLaren Edition comes with orange and black-themed OxygenOS software. Pull down the notification drawer or open up the app drawer and you\u2019ll see orange accents, instead of the standard blue. Don\u2019t worry, there is a way to change the orange back if you\u2019re not a fan (<em>Settings &gt; Display &gt; Theme</em>).</p>",
            "<p>The real reason we\u2019re here, though, is to see exactly what Warp Charge 30 brings to the table.</p>",
            "<p>We plugged in the McLaren Edition and the standard OnePlus 6T with their respective chargers in the box, both starting at 0 percent. Within 20 minutes, the standard OnePlus 6T hit a mere 35 percent, but the McLaren Edition raced ahead with exactly 50 percent at the mark. OnePlus\u2019 claim rings true.</p>",
            "<p>We tested for 10 more minutes to get results after 30 minutes of charging, and the standard 6T reached 54 percent, while the McLaren Edition hit 68 percent. That\u2019s fast, and a solid improvement. It\u2019s a good reason to buy the phone, if you were already eyeing the OnePlus 6T.</p>",
            "<p>But it\u2019s not the fastest charging we\u2019ve ever seen. We recently tested another car-branded phone \u2014 the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/oppo-find-x-lamborghini-edition-product-impressions/\">Oppo Find X Lamborghini Edition</a> \u2014 and it similarly comes with special \u201cSuper VOOC\u201d technology. It managed to hit 100 percent in just 35 minutes of charging, meaning it leaves McLaren in the dust. Still, the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oppo-find-x-review/\">Find X</a> isn\u2019t available in the U.S., and it also costs around $1,500 after converting the price. The OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition is much more sensibly priced.</p>",
            "<p>So what about performance? Does the 10GB of RAM deliver any additional boost to the OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition over the standard model? Not that we\u2019ve seen. We\u2019ve juggled through multiple apps and games at the same time trying to see if it would slow down either the 6T or the McLaren Edition, and both fared without flaw. We\u2019ve already explored <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-much-ram-does-a-smartphone-need/\">how much RAM a smartphone really needs</a>, and you likely won\u2019t see any valuable differences between the 8GB OnePlus RAM models and the new version.</p>",
            "<p>Here are a few benchmark scores to supplement our findings. Keep in mind, OnePlus has been known to <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/oneplus-meizu-benchmark-cheating/\">cheat in benchmark scores</a>\u00a0before, so take these results with a heavy grain of salt.</p>",
            "<p>Compare these to our <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-6t-review/\">OnePlus 6T benchmark scores</a>, and the 6T fares a little better in Geekbench and 3DMark, though the McLaren Edition has a narrow win with AnTuTu. These scores are some of the highest we\u2019ve seen with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, which is the same chip powering most other Android flagship phones, from the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-xl-review/\">Google Pixel 3</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review/\">Samsung Galaxy Note 9</a>. Benchmark scores don\u2019t tell the full story, but you won\u2019t have performance issues with the OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition or the OnePlus 6T.</p>",
            "<p>The OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition costs $699, which is $149 more than the base model you can buy. It\u2019s available now for purchase, but should you get it? We think the fast charging improvements are impressive, and the Papaya Orange theme does offer killer looks. The extra storage and RAM is the cherry on top. If this special edition is within your budget, go for it, especially if you\u2019re a fan of sports cars and McLaren. If not, you\u2019ll be plenty satisfied with the OnePlus 6T, or any one of the phones in our <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-smartphones/\">best smartphones guide</a>.</p>",

            "<p>OnePlus continues to release\u00a0 flagship-level specs and power at a fraction of the price you\u2019d expect. The <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-6t-review/\">OnePlus 6T</a>\u00a0is the latest and it\u2019s packed with tons of power, an amazing camera, and a new notched, bezel-less design. Here\u2019s absolutely everything you need to know about the OnePlus 6T.</p>",
            "<p>The OnePlus 6T is the first time OnePlus\u2019s phones have come to a major U.S. carrier, but that partnership comes with some downsides, too \u2014 namely, slightly slower OS updates.</p>",
            "<p>However, T-Mobile is catching up, thanks to the release of Oxygen OS 9.0.4 for the carrier\u2019s OnePlus 6T units. This update brings with it security updates to November 2018, an improved Nightscape mode, and refinements for the in-display fingerprint scanner. The update is being pushed out to T-Mobile owners, and if you\u2019ve not received it, it\u2019s worth checking Settings &gt; System &gt; System update &gt; Check for update to make sure you\u2019re up to date.</p>",
            "<p>T-Mobile OnePlus 6T units are still an update behind though, with Oxygen OS 9.0.5 having already rolled out to unlocked 6T owners. That means T-Mobile 6Ts will still lack the ability to quick-launch Google Assistant with the power button, but they can probably live with that for now.</p>",
            "<p>OnePlus released the OnePlus 6T in two colors \u2014 midnight black and mirror black \u2014 but may have a special edition waiting in the wings for future release. A series of legitimate-looking <a href=\"https://www.mrgizmo.com/oneplus-6t/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">promotional photos</a> of a more colorful version have been leaked, showing the OnePlus 6T in thunder purple. It certainly looks striking, with a gradient style reminiscent of Huawei\u2019s twilight color, and considerably more visually eye-catching than the black versions we have so far.</p>",
            "<p>OnePlus often produces limited editions of its phones, which are sold in only some markets, and reference to a thunder purple OnePlus 6T has been spotted on the company\u2019s support website in India. This would be the first purple phone we\u2019ve seen from the company. However, there\u2019s no official information yet, so this may be a clever fake, or an abandoned alternative not used.</p>",
            "<p>OnePlus\u2019s phones have always closely followed smartphone design trends, and the OnePlus 6T is no different.</p>",
            "<p>Like the OnePlus 6, the 6T comes with a notched display \u2014 but it\u2019s not the same style of notch that we saw in the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-6-review/\">OnePlus 6</a>. Instead, OnePlus has elected a dewdrop-style notch similar to the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/huawei-mate-20-review/\">Huawei Mate 20</a>\u2018s notch. It packs a lot into the small size though, and the notch still contains a three-in-one ambient/distance/RGB sensor, and a 16-megapixel front-facing lens with an f/2.0 aperture. We like its subtlety \u2014 but if you really hate notches, it can still be hidden through software.</p>",
            "<p>The 6T\u2019s bezels are extremely thin, offering a screen-to-body ratio of 86 percent \u2014 which means the 6.41-inch AMOLED display utterly dominates the front panel. As an AMOLED panel, the OnePlus 6T\u2019s display will have some deeply gorgeous blacks and vibrant colors, and OnePlus has also added a monochrome Reading Mode, and a <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/does-blue-light-ruin-sleep-we-ask-an-expert/\">blue light</a>-cutting Night Mode.</p>",
            "<p>OnePlus\u2019s lauded mute switch is in the same position, and \u2014 flipping the phone over \u2014 you\u2019ll find the two vertically stacked camera lenses, much like the OnePlus 6.</p>",
            "<p>But it\u2019s not all the same for the back panel\u2019s design. You\u2019ll no longer find a fingerprint scanner stuffed under the camera lenses, and it hasn\u2019t returned the bottom of the front bezel. Instead, OnePlus has embraced the future and incorporated an in-display fingerprint scanner. Simply press your finger against the fingerprint icon on the screen, and your phone will unlock. Hold down on the same spot, and you\u2019ll also be able to launch apps from a customizable app shortcut menu.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll be able to get the OnePlus 6T in two colors \u2014 mirror black, and the midnight black that sports a ghostly reflective \u201cS\u201d under the glass. However, a leak has shown a more colorful version, called thunder purple, may be released in the future, potentially as a limited edition. In a first for the OnePlus range, the OnePlus 6T will not be coming with a headphone jack, and will ship with a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter in the box.</p>",
            "<p>OnePlus\u2019s party trick has always been to cram the latest tech into a lower-cost package, and everyone expected the OnePlus 6T to continue that tradition. While we won\u2019t see an upgraded processor yet, the OnePlus 6T\u2019s specs are still worthy of a 2018 flagship.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll find this year\u2019s top \u201cflagchip,\u201d the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/qualcomm-snapdragon-845/\">Snapdragon 845</a>, loaded into the OnePlus 6T. We\u2019ve seen this chip in pretty much every flagship phone this year, so we\u2019re certain the OnePlus 6T will showcase the incredible power and performance we\u2019ve come to expect from this powerful chip.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll get the choice between two models of the 6T; a base model with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of onboard storage, or 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The increased RAM <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-much-ram-does-a-smartphone-need/\">may not boost performance much</a>, but the increased storage may be tempting if you\u2019re a power used \u2014 as usual, there\u2019s no option to expand that storage via MicroSD card.</p>",
            "<p>The battery has been boosted up to a respectable 3,700mAh. We didn\u2019t have any issues with the longevity of the OnePlus 6\u2019s 3,300mAh battery, but it\u2019s always nice to see a larger battery. You\u2019ll also get access to OnePlus\u2019s stupendously fast \u201c<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/oneplus-rename-dash-charge-to-warp-charge/\">don\u2019t-call-it-Dash-Charge</a>\u201d charging.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll find OnePlus\u2019s OxygenOS skin laid over Android in the OnePlus 6T \u2014 but with the pleasant surprise that it\u2019s running over <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-android-p-news/\">Android 9.0 Pie</a>. Some of the largest phone manufacturers haven\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/android-p-when-do-you-get-it/\">yet upgraded their newest flagships</a> to the newest version of Android, so it\u2019s nice to see OnePlus leading the charge with <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-and-worst-features-android-9-pie/\">Android 9.0 Pie</a>.</p>",
            "<p>OxygenOS will come with <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-use-android-9-pie-gesture-navigation/\">Android Pie\u2019s new gesture navigation</a>, but OnePlus has also put its own spin on it, including some refinements. Users will be able to draw a pause signal on their lockscreen to pause music, or draw specific letters to launch apps.</p>",
            "<p>You should see a more responsive phone as well, thanks to the new Smart Boost mode. This feature stores data from commonly used apps in your phone\u2019s RAM, speeding up start-up times by around 5 to 20 percent. According to OnePlus, this is especially useful in apps requiring large amounts of input and output data \u2014 which includes games.</p>",
            "<p>Games have been given a more direct new feature, too, with an improved gaming mode that reduces notifications, locks the screen brightness, and prioritizes data for gaming performance. It will now show notifications from messaging apps and calls as small floating bubbles, so you can stay updated without impacting your gaming performance.</p>",
            "<p>The OnePlus 6T comes with a number of options for biometric unlocking. You\u2019ll have access to the aforementioned in-display fingerprint scanner, but Face Unlock is available too \u2014 and OnePlus boasts it can unlock the phone in 0.4 seconds, making it snappier than a crocodile with chewing gum.</p>",
            "<p>OnePlus has chosen to let one recent trend slip by though \u2014 the increased emergence of triple lens systems like those on the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/huawei-p20-pro-review/\">Huawei P20 Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/lg-v40-thinq-review/\">LG V40 ThinQ</a> \u2014 so you\u2019ll just find two lenses on the back of the OnePlus 6T.</p>",
            "<p>But that doesn\u2019t mean the OnePlus 6T is lacking \u2014 on the contrary, the two lenses on the rear of the phone are highly capable. There\u2019s a 16-megapixel main lens with optical image stabilization and an f/1.7 aperture, backed up by a secondary 20-megapixel lens with an f/1.7 aperture.</p>",
            "<p>There\u2019s A.I.-driven image recognition available here, too, so the 6T\u2019s camera will be able to recognize scenes and automatically adjust settings to fit whatever is found in the viewfinder. Those adjustments apply to the 6T\u2019s portrait mode, and will even boost low-light performance by recognizing when a night shot is being made, thanks to the new Nightscape tech. Nightscape is also coming to the OnePlus 6.</p>",
            "<p>The OnePlus 6T also comes with some impressive video capabilities, too. You\u2019ll be able to capture 4K video at 60 frames per second, but 240-fps slow motion will also be available at 1080p, and 480-fps super slow motion will be available at 720p resolutions.</p>",
            "<p>You don\u2019t have to wait any longer for the revolutionary OnePlus 6T \u2014 it\u2019s now available, for $549. OnePlus is also teaming up with T-Mobile, making this the first time the phone will be available on a U.S. carrier. You can pick up the OnePlus 6T from T-Mobile for better than half price over 24 months.

            "<p>Flagship phones may have a lot to offer, but they\u2019re really expensive, and getting pricier by the month. That, however, is where OnePlus comes in. The company has been building flagship-tier phones for a number of years now and usually offers them at a lower price than other flagship devices. The latest is the new <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-6t-review/\">OnePlus 6T</a>, which boasts a <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/qualcomm-snapdragon-845/\">Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor</a>, up to 8GB of RAM, and more.</p>",
            "<p>Of course, you may be wondering how you can get your hands on the new <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/oneplus-6t-news/\">OnePlus 6T</a> for yourself \u2014 which is exactly why we\u2019ve put together this guide. This time around, for the first time, OnePlus is offering the 6T through a carrier in the U.S. thanks to its partnership with T-Mobile \u2014 essentially giving you more options than ever to buy the phone.</p>",
            "<p>No matter what your situation, here\u2019s how to get your hands on the OnePlus 6T.</p>",
            "<p>Before buying the OnePlus 6T, it\u2019s important to note that like previous OnePlus models, the device is GSM-only. Unlike previous models, Verizon has certified the OnePlus 6T to work on its network, so you will be able to buy the phone unlocked and take it to Verizon. In other words, the only major network that the OnePlus 6T won\u2019t work on is Sprint, so if you\u2019re on Sprint you\u2019ll need to switch in order to use the OnePlus 6T. That also means that Sprint\u2019s mobile virtual network operators won\u2019t support the phone \u2014 like Boost Mobile.</p>",
            "<p>As usual, the OnePlus 6T is available unlocked and you will be able to get it directly <a href=\"https://www.oneplus.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">through the OnePlus website</a>. Of course, if you do so you\u2019ll have to pay for the OnePlus 6T upfront, which is something to keep in mind. The phone is now up for sale, and it\u2019s available in a few different colors, though the color you get may impact pricing. Pricing for the phone can be found below.</p>",
            "<p>Other than the OnePlus website, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll be able to buy the phone through Amazon and other retail partners, though no announcements have been made yet.</p>",
            "<p>For the first time, OnePlus is offering the OnePlus 6T through a carrier in the U.S., and that carrier is T-Mobile. Like the unlocked version, the T-Mobile OnePlus 6T is now available. Unlike the unlocked version, however, T-Mobile is only offering one variant of the phone \u2014 the mirror black version with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.</p>",
            "<p>Through T-Mobile, the phone comes at $580 outright, which equates to $24.17 per month for 24 months on T-Mobile\u2019s Equipment Installment Plan. T-Mobile is also offering up to $300 off for an eligible trade-in, and if you get the full amount you\u2019ll only pay $11.67 per month for 24 months.</p>",
            "<p>The OnePlus 6T can be purchased directly through OnePlus, just like before; but it\u2019s also now sold by more networks than before, too. O2 continues as OnePlus\u2019s partner, and <a href=\"https://www.o2.co.uk/shop/oneplus/6t#contractType=paymonthly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has pre-order deals</a> that provide twice the amount of included data, and the option to change data plans regularly. The deals run from now until December 5, and the phone will be available from November 6.</p>",
            "<p>Joining O2 for the OnePlus 6T are <a href=\"https://shop.ee.co.uk/mobile-phones/pay-monthly/oneplus-6t-128gb-mirror-black/details\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EE</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vodafone.co.uk/brands/oneplus/6t/index.htm?cid=ppc-wvm/pm/_71700000042683281_/prch/an&amp;cid=ppc&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwguDeBRDCARIsAGxuU8bTUpGRg7wYPFEH2Gefz7QIkSdqEhrLwW7NqJ72HSTcmS4J38WfBu4aAoQIEALw_wcB#Mirror_Black/128\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vodafone</a>. Both offer the phone with monthly plans, and will include a subscription to certain online streaming services, too.

The device boasts a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor and up to 8GB of RAM, plus it offers a modern design with a small teardrop notch. But the phone isn\u2019t perfect. Since its release in November, a number of issues related to the device have popped up online \u2014 and if you\u2019re using a OnePlus 6T, you may find yourself dealing with them.</p>",
            "<p>Thankfully, many of the issues seem to have potential fixes. Here are the most common OnePlus 6T problems and how you can fix them.</p>",
            "<p>New <a href=\"https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/snapchat-mic-issue.864181/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reports</a> are <a href=\"https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/bad-microphone-quality.843871/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">popping up</a> that the OnePlus 6T is having some microphone issues. According to the reports, audio being captured from the phone sounds tinny and distant when used with some third-party apps like Snapchat and WhatsApp. That seems to be because the device is using the wrong microphone \u2014 it\u2019s using a microphone in the earpiece, which is largely supposed to be used for noise cancellation.</p>",
            "<p>It doesn\u2019t seem as though all third-party apps are affected, but at least a handful are. Thankfully, the issue is likely a software one instead of a hardware one \u2014 which means that OnePlus could potentially fix this issue with a software update.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Potential solutions:</strong></p>",
            "<p>Some users have <a href=\"https://www.bgr.in/news/oneplus-6t-users-reporting-battery-drain-issue-caused-by-an-unknown-bug/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> that their battery seems to be draining faster than usual. While not huge, the 3,700mAh battery\u00a0<em>should</em> get you through a day of use, or at least close to it \u2014 however, some users are reporting that their battery life has been cut in half.</p>",
            "<p>Unfortunately, this is another issue that doesn\u2019t seem to have a fix yet, though a few users are suggesting that factory resetting the device is helping.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Potential solutions:</strong></p>",
            "<p>Another issue that\u2019s being reported by users is that a recent update to the T-Mobile version of the OnePlus 6T is breaking the device\u2019s certification \u2014 which means that you can\u2019t access Google Play and download apps and content.</p>",

            "<p>While Android 9.0 Pie brings lots of great new features, its updated navigation gestures are not among them. You\u2019ll want to enable the far superior navigation gestures in OxygenOS as soon as you turn on the OnePlus 6T to avoid a lot of headaches.</p>",
            "<p>To enable the custom navigation features, go to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Buttons &amp; Gestures &gt; Navigation Bar &amp; Gestures.\u00a0</em>Select the radio button next to\u00a0<i>Navigation Gestures.\u00a0</i>Once enabled, you simply need to swipe up from the bottom of the display to return to the home screen.</p>",

            "<p>Ambient Display shows basic information such as the time, battery percentage, and notification icons. It\u2019s a good idea to set up two customizations for this feature.

            "<p>Setting up these customizations takes just a few moments. You\u2019ll need to go to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Display &gt; Ambient Display.\u00a0</em>Toggle on the sliders next to\u00a0<i>Turn On\u00a0Screen To Show\u00a0</i>and\u00a0<em>New Notifications.\u00a0</em></p>",
            "<p>One of the quickest ways to make your phone feel more familiar is by customizing its interface. While you\u2019re setting up your new OnePlus 6T, you\u2019ll want to customize your theme and accent colors to match your preferences.</p>",
            "<p>When you\u2019re ready to change your theme and accent colors, go to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Display &gt; Theme.\u00a0</em>From here, you can choose the radio button that matches your preferred theme. Next, tap <em>Accent Color\u00a0</em>and choose the color you\u2019d like to use, followed by <em>OK.\u00a0</em></p>",
            "<p>Sure, the OnePlus 6T has awesome battery life, but you\u2019ll still want to have an idea just how much juice you have left. Luckily, there\u2019s an easy setting to update on your phone that will let you quickly see your current battery percentage in the status bar.</p>",
            "<p>To display battery percentage information, head to\u00a0<em>Settings&gt; Display &gt; Status Bar\u00a0</em>and toggle the slider next to\u00a0<em>Show Battery Percentage.\u00a0</em>If you\u2019d like, you can also tap <em>Battery Style </em>to customize the battery icon that appears in the status bar.</p>",
            "<p>If you don\u2019t like tapping the power button each time you want to unlock your OnePlus 6T, you can easily set up a gesture to wake your phone. Double Tap to Wake does just what it says: It allows you to wake the phone with a double tap to the screen.</p>",
            "<p>To enable Double Tap to Wake, go to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Buttons &amp; Gestures &gt; Quick Gestures.\u00a0</em>Toggle on the slider next to\u00a0<em>Double Tap To Wake.\u00a0</em>While you\u2019re here, you may also want to toggle on the slider for\u00a0<em>Flip To Mute.\u00a0</em></p>",
            "<p>Google Assistant is an invaluable feature that provides lots of information about your day. If you\u2019re a frequent Google Assistant user, you\u2019ll quickly realize the feature is a whole lot more difficult to access when you\u2019re using the new OxygenOS navigation gestures. Fortunately, OnePlus has a setting that allows you to hold the power button to open <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-assistant/\">Google Assistant</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Setting up the feature takes just a moment. Go to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Buttons &amp; Gestures\u00a0</em>and toggle the slider next to\u00a0<em>Quick Activate The Assistant App.\u00a0</em>Once the feature is activated, just hold the power button to access Google Assistant. If you want to access the power button menu, you\u2019ll need to hold the power button a little longer than normal.</p>",
            "<p>Again, we can\u2019t complain about the battery life on the OnePlus 6T. It\u2019s plenty to get you through a day with a little to spare. However, if you do tend to test the limits of your battery, you should turn on the Battery Saver mode. With Battery Saver enabled, your phone\u2019s performance will degrade slightly when that battery is almost depleted in order to eke out a little more time.</p>",
            "<p>To enable Battery Saver, head to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Battery Saver.\u00a0</em>Toggle the slider next to\u00a0<em>Turn On Automatically\u00a0</em>and adjust the slider to the percentage at which you would like Battery Saver to begin working.</p>",
            "<p>One thing\u2019s for sure: There\u2019s no shortage of ways to unlock your OnePlus 6T. While you\u2019ll probably use the Face Unlock feature or in-display fingerprint sensor, there are privacy and legal concerns surrounding these features. Lockdown is a button you can tap that will disable all authentication methods other than your PIN or Pattern. This is a feature you\u2019ll definitely want to enable.</p>",
            "<p>You add the Lockdown button to your power button menu by going to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Security Lock &amp; Screen &gt; Lock Screen Preferences,</em>\u00a0and toggle on the slider next to\u00a0<em>Show Lockdown Option</em>. Once you\u2019ve finished, you can tap the power button to access the Lockdown button.</p>",
            "<p>While Smart Lock isn\u2019t an exclusive feature for the OnePlus 6T, it\u2019s one of the most convenient you\u2019ll find in Android. Smart Lock allows you to define certain areas and circumstances where your phone will automatically unlock. Unless you have very sensitive information on your phone, this is a feature you\u2019ll probably want to set up.</p>",
            "<p>To set up Smart Lock go to\u00a0<em>Settings &gt; Security &amp; Lock Screen &gt; Smart Unlock.\u00a0</em>Enter your PIN or Pattern. Tap\u00a0<em>On-Body Detection\u00a0</em>if you\u2019d like the phone to remain unlocked when you have it on your person. Select\u00a0<em>Trusted Places\u00a0</em>if you\u2019d like to establish certain spots where the phone stays unlocked. If you\u2019d prefer to keep your phone unlocked when it\u2019s close to certain equipment like your laptop, press the\u00a0<em>Trusted Devices\u00a0</em>button.</p>"
