            "<p>Samsung\u2019s new <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-review/\">Galaxy S9 smartphone</a> may not look radically different from the previous year\u2019s model, but it adds some nifty features like <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/ar-emojis-samsung-galaxy-s9-test/\">AR Emoji</a> and \u201csuper slow-mo,\u201d the latter of which gives users the ability to record video in (small bursts of) slow motion. Super slow-mo records video at 960 fps in 720p resolution. It\u2019s an easy feature to use, and once you learn how, you will be able to take some incredibly stylish shots. Here\u2019s how to get started.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the camera app. At the top of the screen, you will see the current mode the camera is in. Swipe right until you get to <em>Super Slow-Mo</em>.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can now choose whether to manually activate slow-mo, or have it trigger automatically.</p>",
            "<p>In manual mode, simply tap the record button to start recording video. Next, tap the button to the right to begin recording in slow-motion.</p>",
            "<p>The S9 will only record slow-motion in 0.2-second bursts (when the video is played, this ends up being about 6.4 seconds of footage). You can, however, tap the slow-mo button again, recording multiple slow-mo sections in one video.</p>",
            "<p>If you choose automatic slow-mo, tap the record button, and a square will appear in the camera\u2019s viewfinder. When the camera detects motion within the square, it will begin recording in slow-motion (again, it will only do so for 0.2 seconds). Line up the viewfinder so the person or object you want to record will move through the square, and you should be good to go. As with manual mode, the S9 can record multiple bursts of slow-mo in one video.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you finish recording your video, it will appear in the phone\u2019s gallery. You can tell which videos have slow-motion segments because they will sport an icon depicting multiple circles. Once you select the video, you will see that same icon on the screen. Tap it, and the bar at the bottom of the screen (which tells you how far into the video you are) will display marks to show which segments are in slow-motion.</p>",
            "<p>You can edit the video, adding music, toggling slow-motion on or off, and trimming sections of the footage. Swipe up to get additional options, such as making the footage loop or play in reverse.</p>",
            "<p>That\u2019s all there is to it. Have fun experimenting with slow-motion recording.</p>",

Whether you want to\u00a0buy the phone through a carrier or directly from Samsung, here\u2019s how to get your hand on\u00a0the Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus.</p>",
            "<p>Now that pre-orders are over, the Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus are now available for purchase straight from the Samsung website. You\u2019ll also be able to get your hands on the device from retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, Sam\u2019s Club, Target, and Walmart.</p>",
            "<p>If you\u2019re looking for the most diverse range of storage options, purchasing from Samsung is your best bet. In April, the smartphone manufacturer announced it would release a 128GB and 256GB storage option for the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus exclusively on its <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/\">website</a>.</p>",
            "<p>The 128GB Galaxy S9 sells for $770 while the same storage configuration on the Galaxy S9 Plus will set you back $890. If you want to max out your storage a 256GB option of the Galaxy S9 will be available for $820, while the S9 Plus of the same size will sell for $940 \u2014 but only during pre-order. After pre-orders are finished, the pricing will go up to $840 for the 256GB Galaxy S9, and $960 for the Galaxy S9 Plus. Pre-orders began on May 1, and the devices will be available for purchase on May 18. If you pre-order a Galaxy S9 or S9 Plus with a 128GB or 256GB storage capacity before May 17, you\u2019ll also opt for either a free Gear IconX or Samsung Gear S3 Frontier for $100.</p>",
            "<p>If you choose to pick up the Galaxy S9 or S9 Plus from <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/\">Samsung.com</a> or through the <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/explore/shop-samsung-app/\">Shop Samsung app</a>, then you can pick up an unlocked version of the Samsung Galaxy S9 for $720, or $30 a month for 24 months. The larger S9 Plus will set you back a little more \u2014\u00a0$840, or $35 a month, for 24 months.</p>",
            "<p>If you\u2019re upgrading from an older Galaxy device, then Samsung is also offering a trade-in program that could save you up to $300 on a new Galaxy S9 or S9 Plus. The details of this trade in\u00a0option are available on <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/trade-in/\">Samsung\u2019s site</a>, as\u00a0is the list of models that can be traded in.</p>",

            "<p>The phones come at $33 per month for the Galaxy S9 or $38 per month for the S9 Plus on Sprint\u2019s Flex lease program. Through Sprint, you\u2019ll also be able to get a $150 gift card if you switch your phone number to Sprint.</p>",
            "<p>If you\u2019re looking for two new Galaxy S9 phones, Sprint may have the perfect deal for you. The carrier is offering a limited-time lease offer that offers a monthly bill credit for one device when you lease two. For example, if you lease two Galaxy S9 phones, you\u2019ll see a monthly lease charge of $66 as well as a bill credit for $33.</p>",
            "<p>Sprint says the phone is also available from Boost Mobile.</p>",

            "<p><a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-review/\">The Samsung Galaxy S9</a>, one of the most advanced smartphones in the world, can be forced into a reboot by a particularly complex shader, says research by <a href=\"http://www.graphicsfuzz.com/\">U.K. GPU testing company GraphicsFuzz</a> and <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/the-snapdragon-samsung-galaxy-s9-has-a-gpu-stability-bug-that-can-be-exploited-to-trigger-remote-reboots/\">XDA Developers</a>.</p>",
            "<p>According to GraphicsFuzz, the discovery came about during testing of the Galaxy S9\u2019s rendering capabilities, and was not intended to be malicious. The issue stems from a problem with how the phone\u2019s Adreno 630 graphics driver attempts to render a particularly complex shader inside Samsung\u2019s default Samsung Internet app.</p>",
            "<p>According to a deeper investigation, the graphics driver starts the process of creating the shader, but fails at one of the initial steps of allocating resources. The browser fails to terminate the process properly, which causes the phone to panic and reboot.</p>",
            "<p>The issue is reproducible on other browsers \u2014 but though the shader does cause the phone to freeze, only on the Samsung Internet browser is the phone forced to reboot, meaning the problem is seemingly specific to Samsung\u2019s browser. Since the issue only affects the Galaxy S9 models equipped with the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/qualcomm-snapdragon-845/\">Snapdragon 845</a> (unfortunately means the majority of the models in the U.S.), it seems that it\u2019s the pairing of Samsung\u2019s browser and Qualcomm\u2019s graphics driver causing the problem.</p>",
            "<p>This assumption can be backed up by reproducing a similar error on the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-2-xl-review/\">Google Pixel 2 XL</a>. That phone is equipped with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 and Adreno 540 graphics driver, and when subjected to the same test on Samsung Internet, the browser slows to a crawl \u2014 though a reboot isn\u2019t forced.</p>",
            "<p>A video of the problem has been made available, and shows the lengthy freeze, as well as the forced reboot of the device.</p>",
            "<p>The problem here is that the bug is reproducible, and capable of being deployed to remotely attack and force affected Samsung Galaxy S9 models into reboots. Thankfully, as soon as this became apparent to GraphicsFuzz, it reached out to XDA Developers in order to contact Samsung. In a disclosure timeline, XDA reported that a Samsung engineer had been assigned to the case on April 4, and it can be hoped that a fix will be deployed to rectify this problem soon.</p>"

            "<p>Embedded into the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-review/\">Samsung Galaxy S9\u2019s</a> camera app, <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-use-ar-emoji/\">AR Emoji</a> allows you to use the front-facing camera to create and send digital cartoon avatars.\u00a0Similar to Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/apple/animoji-ios-11/\">Animojis</a> in concept, AR Emoji\u00a0captures your facial movements and mirrors them in the form of a character or animal. But with its \u201cCreate My Emoji\u201d feature, you can also create one of yourself by simply taking a selfie \u2014 allowing you to choose a skin tone, outfit, hairstyle, hair color, and glasses.</p>",
            "<p>With AR Emoji, Samsung set out to solve what it sees as a problem \u2014 finding a way to replace existing emojis with ones that are interactive. The company wanted to do this in a way that was simple, by providing users with the right tools to capture emotion but still allowed them to easily share the result on a variety of messaging platforms.</p>",
            "<p>So, how did Samsung create its AR Emojis? For starters, it went straight to the 3D animation experts who brought to life some of Hollywood\u2019s most popular characters.</p>",
            "<p>To power the new feature, Samsung collaborated with\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.loomai.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Loom.ai</a> \u2014\u00a0 a San Francisco-based startup specializing in 3D animation. The company\u2019s software allows users to create fully personalized and customizable 3D avatars from a single photograph, without custom hardware or depth sensors.Through a partnership and a software development kit (SDK), Samsung combined Loom.ai\u2019s technology with the S9\u2019s camera tech (augmented reality and facial recognition) to make custom AR Emoji possible.</p>",
            "<p>The vision behind Loom.ai all started with movies \u2014 cartoons and superheros to be exact. Having previously worked at popular visual effects companies like DreamWorks and Lucasfilm, Loom.ai\u2019s founders \u2013Mahesh Ramasubramanian and Kiran Bhat \u2014 have helped bring well-known characters, such as Shrek and the Hulk, to the big screen.</p>",
            "<p>To inject personality into those characters, they used performance-capture technology to incorporate the actors who played them \u2014 recording the movements of the actor, not their visual appearance. But after seeing how movie audiences reacted to their 3D creations, Ramasubramanian and Bhat decided to take that technology further \u2014 beyond Hollywood \u2014 by starting Loom.ai, which focuses on smartphones.</p>",
            "<p>\u201cPeople instantly react to having these characters come to life when it\u2019s driven by human actors,\u201d Ramasubramanian, who serves as CEO and co-founder, told Digital Trends. \u201cWe started Loom.ai with the goal that we need to be able to find an easy way for every individual to be able to see themselves in 3D, and for that we had to build a new technology.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>With feature films, creating a 3D avatar requires tons of equipment \u2014 expensive hardware and software, makeup, and a studio setting. But Loom.ai found a way to simplify the process of capturing a person\u2019s features without the usual tools; instead, its patented technology uses a single photograph and deep learning to analyze an image. If a photograph is free of any facial expressions, the deep-learning algorithm looks at the pixels and\u00a0automatically produces a face that encapsulates the correct muscle movement.</p>",
            "<p>\u201cWhen Samsung\u2019s partnership rolled around we had a chance to implement that sophisticated technology on a device, which we feel is already a pretty compelling engineering task by itself,\u201d Bhat, Loom.ai\u2019s CTO and co-founder, told Digital Trends. \u201cIt\u2019s a big technology jump in being able to take some of those ideas and aspirations from the big screen and bring it to mobile.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>Incorporating this technology into the Galaxy S9 hardware required Loom.ai to restructure its algorithms, in order to run on the device. But Loom.ai did not create AR Emoji alone: Both Ramasubramanian and Bhat credit Samsung in dedicating tremendous effort into optimizing the software. By providing the SDK to integrate into smartphones, the Loom.ai founders think Samsung can make the framework much richer by adding more content and customizability options in the future.</p>",
            "<p>So, how exactly does the S9 (and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-review/\">S9 Plus</a>) create AR Emojis? While Samsung didn\u2019t reveal its secret sauce, it gave Digital Trends a look under the hood.</p>",
            "<p>Working off Loom.ai\u2019s technology, the phone\u2019s camera captures and processes a 2D image into 3D. To enhance this further, the S9 uses additional software \u2014 facial tracking and Samsung\u2019s Blend Shape technology \u2014 to provide facial expressions for the AR Emoji.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019re then left with a cartoon-like version of yourself that can emote 18 different expressions \u2014 which Samsung plans on slowly expanding to 54 \u2014 ranging from joy and pleasure, to sorrow and anger. All data is also local to the device, and doesn\u2019t get stored anywhere else.</p>",
            "<p>Both working together, facial tracking technology tracks over 100 facial features in real time (such as winking or smiling) to capture individual emotions, while Blend Shape helps to deliver a greater range of them \u2014 which blends expressions together based on 75 basic human facial features. Samsung says, for Blend Shape, it conducted at least 100 tests on a weekly basis within its labs, in order to make sure there is enough data that would entice its users. (Blend Shape is also used to create its Disney AR Emojis, like Mickey and Minnie Mouse.)</p>",
            "<p>In our own <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/ar-emojis-samsung-galaxy-s9-test/\">AR Emoji test</a>, a majority of us felt our characters looked extremely inaccurate. One writer felt there was a lack of skin-tone options available, with no dark-skinned tones to choose from. Others felt their AR Emoji didn\u2019t look anything like them, which made editing the avatar seem like more of a chore than an enjoyable task.</p>",
            "<p>According to Loom.ai, creating an accurate AR Emoji relies heavily on the way the selfie is shot.\u00a0Users should go about taking the photo the same way they\u2019d take a passport photo. \u201cYou want even lighting, nothing covering your face, and a neutral expression so that we can add the expressions later,\u201d Ramasubramanian explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of people getting a little accustomed to it and then seeing the possibilities of animating it and using it.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>Ramasubramanian also said that users should treat it the way they would while taking any selfie \u2014 meaning, you can take tons of photos until you\u2019re satisfied with the photo. Since AR Emoji allows you to create multiple avatars, you can compare them to find the one you like best. Each one you create also saves to your phone, so you can switch up the version you use depending on your mood.</p>",
            "<p>The latest update to AR Emoji includes additional hairstyles,\u00a0headwear such as a hijab, and other options. The update is currently rolling out to unlocked versions of the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus in Korea, China, and Europe. European carrier devices and U.S. unlocked devices should have the update available for download this week. The update for U.S. carrier devices will be rolling out over the coming weeks. Samsung says AR Emoji will continue to evolve in the future, but for now, is staying tight lipped on exact details.</p>"

            "<p>There are a few things to consider when buying a smartphone \u2014 you\u2019ll want to think about a phone\u2019s design, camera, performance, and so on. But what about how quickly phones can upload and download files? If speedy internet access is important to you, a new study has been released detailing the fastest phones out there \u2014 and it turns out that Samsung is the winner.</p>",
            "<p>The study comes from <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/best-internet-speed-tests/\">Ookla</a>, the company behind <a href=\"http://www.speedtest.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">speedtest.net</a>, and highlights that the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-s9-news/\">Samsung Galaxy S9</a> and Galaxy S9 Plus significantly outperform other smartphones when it comes to downloading and streaming content. By how much? According to the study, the phones are up to 42 percent faster \u2014 which is no small feat.</p>",
            "<p>The speeds are largely thanks to the CAT 18 LTE modem built into the phones, which are able to deliver download speeds of up to 1.2 Gbps, though that obviously depends on network speeds. The real takeaway here is the fact that, depending on which phone you use, you could experience significantly different speeds, even on the same network and in the same area. The study highlights that the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus boast speeds of up to 37 percent faster than the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-x-review/\">iPhone X</a>, 17 percent faster than the Google Pixel 2, and 38 percent faster than the Galaxy S7.</p>",
            "<p>\u201cThis summer, consumers are going to be on the road, at the beach, and relying on their phones more than ever, but without the latest and fastest network technology that\u2019s available in the Galaxy S9 and S9+, their phones may quite literally slow them down,\u201d said Justin Denison, senior vice president, Mobile Product Strategy and Marketing at Samsung Electronics America, in an emailed statement.</p>",
            "<p>The Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus aren\u2019t just fast \u2014 they also boast the latest and greatest Qualcomm processor, the Snapdragon 845, along with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage.</p>",
            "<p>Data speeds in general are only getting faster. As we move toward 5G, carriers are implementing LTE Advanced networks capable of delivering over 1 Gbps speeds. Of course, that not only hinges on carrier implementation, but also manufacturers taking advantage of new mobile modems that are capable of downloading files at such speeds.</p>"

            "<p>No one has ever accused T-Mobile of being subtle, especially when it comes to the company\u2019s marketing tactics. And the <a href=\"https://newsroom.t-mobile.com/news-and-blogs/samsung-galaxy-s9-guinness-world-record-launch.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">latest stunt</a> the Un-carrier pulled to show off the new <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-review/\">Galaxy S9</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-review/\">S9 Plus</a>\u00a0is certainly no exception to the provider\u2019s over-the-top practices. T-Mobile has managed to set two Guinness World Records titles with the two new Samsung smartphones, and tomorrow, you\u2019ll be able to buy the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-s9-news/\">S9 and S9 Plus</a> at the \u201cindustry\u2019s best prices\u201d from Un-carrier stores across the country.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s not entirely clear what purpose was served by the two new world records T-Mobile now holds, but we suppose it makes for some fun video content. To achieve their spot in history, the team took to Lake Elsinore in California in order to test out the new so-called super phones. The idea was to launch \u201cthe world\u2019s most \u2018extra\u2019 speed test,\u201d which involved several water-skiers, a very large magenta blimp, and the fastest Samsung phones on what T-Mobile claims to be the fastest network in the country.</p>",
            "<p>So what exactly were the world records? One was the fastest text on a touch screen mobile phone while water skiing (honestly, it\u2019s shocking that anyone holds that record), while the other was the longest distance water skied while being towed behind a blimp. Again, unclear why that record exists in the first place. But regardless, bragging rights are bragging rights, and as mobile service providers continue to bicker over who\u2019s best, it always pays to have an extra talking point.</p>",
            "<p>In more useful information, T-Mobile notes that you\u2019ll pay about 10 percent more for the Galaxy S9 if you buy it at AT&amp;T or Sprint, and even more still if you go to Verizon. The Un-carrier, on the other hand, will offer the Midnight Black, Lilac Purple, or Coral Blue Galaxy S9 for $30 a month, or the larger S9 Plus for the same monthly payment but with a $120 down payment. You can also get half off the S9 or $360 off the S9 Plus via bill credits if you trade in your phone. So if you\u2019re looking for a new super device, the latest from Samsung may be calling your name.</p>",

            "<p>The days of securing your phone with just a PIN code or a pattern are long gone, and although the new <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-review/\">Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus</a> both offer those features, they have a selection of other more secure options too. These new security features rely on biometrics \u2014 in this case your fingerprint, iris, or facial features. When you first start up the <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s9/buy/s/Device/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Galaxy S9</a>, you may rush through these options in the excitement of actually using the phone; but they\u2019re important and should be revisited.</p>",
            "<p>Here\u2019s everything you need to know about setting up the security systems on your Galaxy S9 or Galaxy S9 Plus.</p>",
            "<p>You\u2019ll need to dig into the Settings menu to find the right options.</p>",
            "<p>The most reliable way of unlocking your Galaxy S9 is to use the fingerprint scanner. The sensor is located just below the camera lenses on the back of the phone, in a slightly more sensible place than it was on the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8-review/\">Galaxy S8</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Fingerprint verification can be used for <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-pay-news/\">Samsung Pay</a>, and an option for it is found under the same menu.</p>",
            "<p>This is Samsung\u2019s hybrid face and iris unlock system, designed to be more reliable than using just one of these two biometric systems on its own. Even if you enable fingerprint recognition, we still recommend setting this up and giving it a try. We\u2019ve seen varying results, with some people finding it more reliable than others.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s not suitable for high-security features like Samsung Pay, and Samsung warns that Intelligent Scan could be fooled by someone who looks like you. It\u2019s less secure than a PIN, pattern, or password. Lighting that\u2019s different than when you set the system up may confuse it, along with glasses, hats, fake noses (probably), and other changes to your face following registration.</p>",
            "<p>Once you\u2019ve read the warnings and advice, you\u2019ll be guided to hold the phone up to your face, in adequate lighting, ready to register your face. This takes a very short amount of time. Next is iris recognition, and if you wear glasses or contact lenses, you should remove them.</p>",
            "<p>With this done, you\u2019ll be prompted to activate Intelligent Scan. Returning to the main menu, we recommend making sure both <em>Intelligent Scan unlock</em> and <em>Screen-on Intelligent Scan</em> are activated.</p>",
            "<p>There are plenty of security options on the Galaxy S9, so why not use them all?</p>",
            "<p>Using Intelligent Scan may sound as simple as holding your phone up to your face, and it is \u2014 but there are a few things to know about using Intelligent Scan effectively. First, you should wake the phone to the lock screen using the sleep/wake key on the side of the phone. Look out for the red LED, which lights up when Intelligent Scan is active. Provided you\u2019re in decent lighting, and aren\u2019t too close to the phone\u2019s screen, it should work on a consistent basis. If it\u2019s not working, go back and re-register your face and iris again. Varying lighting conditions, especially during this stage, really do affect Intelligent Scan\u2019s performance.</p>",
            "<p>The fingerprint sensor is the faster way to wake the phone, as touching the sensor unlocks the device without the extra step of pressing the sleep/wake key. To make it more convenient, register your index finger on both hands, so you don\u2019t have to juggle the phone if you pick it up with the \u201cwrong\u201d hand.</p>",
            "<p>That\u2019s about it for the security settings on the Samsung Galaxy S9, and all the instructions apply to the Galaxy S9 Plus as well. Protecting your phone with one or more of these methods is essential.</p>"

            "<p>The Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus are finally here, showcasing a number of awesome new features, top-tier specs, and what could turn out to be a pretty ground-breaking new camera. The new phones may not look all that different from their predecessors, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus, but they clearly still have a lot to offer.</p>",
            "<p>But which one is the one for you? The Galaxy S9 Plus isn\u2019t just a bigger version of the Galaxy S9 \u2014 it also offers a few extra features that might be important. Here\u2019s our comparison of the two phones, aimed at helping you figure out which phone is the best choice for your needs.</p>",
            "<p>The two phones feature similar specs, to be sure, but the Galaxy S9 Plus clearly has an advantage under the hood.</p>",
            "<p>Let\u2019s start with the similarities between the two devices. For starters, you\u2019ll get the same <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/qualcomm-snapdragon-845/\">Qualcomm Snapdragon 845</a> processor, which is Qualcomm\u2019s latest and greatest smartphone mobile chip. You\u2019ll also get the same 64GB of storage, and a MicroSD card slot to expand upon that storage if you so choose.</p>",
            "<p>There\u2019s one big difference here, and that\u2019s the fact that the Galaxy S9 Plus features 6GB of RAM, rather than the 4GB of RAM you\u2019ll find in the standard Galaxy S9. That could help make the larger phone a little more powerful, especially for those that multitask a lot.</p>",
            "<p>The phones are similar, and most will find the Galaxy S9 plenty powerful, but, because of its extra RAM, the Galaxy S9 Plus edges out the smaller phone.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus</strong></p>",
            "<p>The phones don\u2019t just feature similar specs. They also offer almost identical designs. It\u2019s a very nice design though. The front is largely taken up by the beautifully curved Infinity Display, with features like the Iris Scanner and front-facing camera in a sleek forehead at the top of the phone.</p>",
            "<p>Around the back of the device, you\u2019ll find the fingerprint sensor and camera. That\u2019s one of the biggest differences between the standard Galaxy S9 and the Galaxy S9 Plus \u2014 the Plus model features a dual-sensor camera, and you\u2019ll see that in the slightly bigger camera module on the back. On the back, you\u2019ll also find that the fingerprint sensor has been moved a little, which is a good thing. The sensor is now much more accessible, and should be far easier to use. The phones also still feature the Bixby button, which you\u2019ll probably either love or hate.</p>",
            "<p>The display on the phone is also pretty similar, though it\u2019s bigger on the Galaxy S9 Plus. The standard-sized phone features a 5.8-inch AMOLED display, while the larger phone boasts a 6.2-inch AMOLED display. Both devices feature a resolution of 2,960 x 1,440 pixels, and as a result the pixel density on the smaller device is a little higher. Still, it\u2019s a fair trade-off for a slightly bigger screen, and most people won\u2019t be able to tell the difference anyway.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Tie</strong></p>",
            "<p>The camera is perhaps the biggest point of difference between the Galaxy S9 and the Galaxy S9 Plus, though both cameras offer some pretty awesome features. The standard Galaxy S9 features a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera, while the Galaxy S9 Plus features a dual rear-facing camera with a 12-megapixel main lens and a 12-megapixel telephoto lens.</p>",
            "<p>Both devices offer one feature that we\u2019ve never seen on a smartphone before: A variable aperture. What that means is that users can switch the aperture between f/1.5 and f/2.4, which should help make for\u00a0<em>much</em> better low-light shots, and better control for those that like to dive into manual shooting. You\u2019ll actually see the aperture change on the back of the phone as you switch it \u2014 it\u2019s a mechanical feature.</p>",
            "<p>The camera also offers some other pretty cool features. For example, it boasts ultra high-speed video recording at a massive 960 frames per second, though it can only record for a fraction of a second.</p>",
            "<p>As mentioned, the Galaxy S9 Plus offers a dual rear-facing camera, which unlocks a few new features \u2014 including a portrait mode, live focus, and 2x optical zoom.</p>",
            "<p>Because of those new features, the Galaxy S9 Plus is the winner here.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus</strong></p>",
            "<p>Because the Galaxy S9 Plus is a bigger phone, there\u2019s simply more room for the battery. The standard Galaxy S9 features a 3,000mAh battery, while the bigger phone offers a 3,500mAh battery. It does have a larger display to power, but we think that it\u2019ll still boast longer battery life.</p>",
            "<p>The phones offer a few great charging options. The S9 and S9 Plus, like many Samsung phones before them, feature wireless charging through both the Qi and PMA standards. There\u2019s also fast charging through Qualcomm\u2019s Quick Charge 2.0. Because of the larger battery, we\u2019re awarding this one to the Galaxy S9 Plus.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus</strong></p>",
            "<p>Both the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus feature Android 8.0 Oreo, and over the top you\u2019ll find Samsung\u2019s own software. The phones offer all the features you would expect from Android Oreo \u2014 including the likes of picture-in-picture mode. Of course, you\u2019ll also get Samsung-specific features such as Bixby.</p>",
            "<p>In general, Bixby hasn\u2019t been very highly reviewed, and it doesn\u2019t seem as though the digital assistant has been upgraded a whole lot for the new phone.</p>",
            "<p>The software on the Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus isn\u2019t all that different from what you\u2019ll find in the Galaxy S8. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing \u2014 many love Samsung\u2019s take on Android, especially in recent years.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Tie</strong></p>",
            "<p>The Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus are set to be pretty widely available. The phones will be available for pre-order starting on March 2, with March 16 set to be the date that they become widely available online and in-store. Through Samsung, you\u2019ll be able to get the standard device for $720, while the larger Galaxy S9 Plus comes at $840. The phone is also available through all major carriers in the U.S., as well as unlocked through other outlets. You can check out our <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-s9-availability/\">full buying guide for the Galaxy S9 here</a>.</p>",
            "<p>The phones are available from all the same outlets \u2014 so here it\u2019s down to price. Because of the fact that the Galaxy S9 is cheaper, it\u2019s the winner here.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S9</strong></p>",
            "<p>The better, more powerful phone is the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus. Not only does it feature a little more RAM, but it also offers a slightly improved camera.</p>",
            "<p>But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you should go for the Galaxy S9 Plus over the standard version. If you don\u2019t really care about the dual-sensor features, don\u2019t multitask a lot, and don\u2019t need a bigger display, then the Galaxy S9 is still an all-around excellent phone, with a ton of great features.</p>"

            "<p>With just days until its official release, some lucky folks are already finding the new Samsung Galaxy S9 on their doorsteps. While the new features alone are sure to delight Galaxy S9 owners, Samsung is making it easier to repair your new device should it become damaged. The smartphone giant is partnering with uBreakiFix to offer same-day, in-person authorized service for Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus owners as well as older Galaxy devices including Galaxy S6, S7, S8 models, the Note8, and the Note5.</p>",
            "<p>Samsung\u2019s partnership with uBreakiFix is just the latest in a series of new services meant to improve overall user experience Last year the company introduced the Samsung Premium Care program, offering in-home support and repair options. Now with the addition of uBreakiFix in-store repair options, users have even more flexibility when choosing a repair option. Michael Lawder, Samsung\u2019s senior vice president of customer experience, called the partnership a \u201chuge investment in customer experience\u201d for Galaxy owners.</p>",
            "<p>The partnership with uBreakiFix doesn\u2019t just benefit Samsung Premium Care customers, however \u2014 all Galaxy owners now have a convenient repair option with more than 300 authorized locations across the country for both in-warranty and out-of-warranty service. While the current number of authorized repair locations is impressive alone, Samsung hopes to add nearly 200 more locations to the mix by early 2019.</p>",
            "<p><a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/support/ubreakifix/\">Service appointments can be made online</a>, or you can simply walk into any authorized uBreakiFix location. While in-warranty repairs will be covered for free, pricing for any out-of-warranty repair is readily available on the <a href=\"http://ubreakifix.com/samsung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">uBreakiFix website</a>, so there are no surprises. All on-site repairs are done by Samsung certified pros using genuine parts, meaning you won\u2019t have to worry any issues down the road from aftermarket hardware. And the best part is that Samsung promises most repairs will be done in two hours.</p>",
            "<p>Samsung isn\u2019t the first smartphone manufacturer to partner with uBreakiFix to provide authorized service. Google uses uBreakiFix as an authorized repair site for its Pixel devices as well. The company also offers out-of-warranty service for a number of smartphone manufacturers. Lawder told Digital Trends that Samsung chose to partner with uBreakiFix for authorized repairs because the company offers excellent customer service as well as convenient locations across the U.S.</p>",

            "<p>Just months after Samsung launched its newest flagships, the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-review/\">Galaxy S9</a> and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-review/\">Galaxy S9 Plus</a>, the smartphone giant announced two new storage configurations for the phones. Both the Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus will soon be available with 128GB and 256GB storage options.</p>",
            "<p>Samsung will offer the 128GB and 256GB versions of the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus exclusively on its website. You can pre-order the phones beginning May 1 and will be able to purchase them on the Samsung website on May 18.</p>",
            "<p>The 128GB version of the Galaxy S9 will set you back $770, while the same storage configuration on the Galaxy S9 Plus comes in at $890. If you want to max out your internal storage, the 256GB Galaxy S9 sells for $820, and the S9 Plus will cost $940. Mind you all Galaxy S9 phones come with a MicroSD slot that will allow you to add up to 400GB of external memory.</p>",
            "<p>The decision to release extended storage options for the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus in the U.S. is a nice surprise: In 2017 Samsung released a Galaxy S8 with 128GB of storage and 6GB of RAM, but the phone was only available in South Korea and China. While Samsung is selling two extended storage options of its flagships in the U.S. this year, neither include additional RAM.</p>",
            "<p>Samsung released the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus this February at Mobile World Congress to rave reviews. While the phone features a powerful Qualcomm 845 (or Exynos 9810) processor and 4GB of RAM, many felt the 64GB of onboard storage was a little chintzy. The addition of a 128GB and 256GB storage option now places the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus on a level playing field with other flagships like the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-x-review/\">iPhone X</a> and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-2-xl-review/\">Pixel 2XL</a>.</p>",
            "<p>While the additional storage may be enough to convince some to pick up a Galaxy S9 or S9 Plus, Samsung is sweetening the deal for people who pre-order the device. If you pre-order either phone on the <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxy-s9/\">Samsung</a> website between May 1 and May 17, you can pick up a <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/headphone-reviews/samsung-gear-iconx-2018-review/\">Gear IconX</a>\u00a0(2018)\u00a0for free or get a <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/wearables/samsung-gear-s3-tumi-edition-news/\">Gear S3 Frontier</a> for $100.</p>"

            "<p>After four quarters of record profits, things have taken a turn for Samsung. \u00a0The South Korean tech giant announced that its second quarter net profit was flat, due in part to a drop in smartphones profitability.</p>",
            "<p>Overall Samsung reported quarterly revenue at 58.48 trillion South Korean won ($52.27 billion), a 4-percent drop from this time last year. Overall profit however came in at 14.87 trillion won ($13.28 billion), around a six-percent increase year-over -year</p>",
            "<p>For its second quarter, Samsung posted a decline in revenue for its mobile business. Revenues for the quarter came in at 24 trillion won ($21 billion), down 20 percent from this time last year. Operating profit also took a sharp turn, down to 2.67 trillion won ($2.38 billion) from 4.06 trillion won ($3.63 billion) this time last year.</p>",
            "<p>The mobile phone division however is eager to make a turnaround for the third quarter and is taking aggressive steps to do so. It\u2019s releasing its flagship Samsung Galaxy Note 9 on August 9, earlier than anticipated to allow more sales in the third quarter. It also stated it will become more aggressive on pricing.</p>",
            "<p>The report confirmed an earlier report by analyst Lee Seung-woo of Eugene Investments, who predicted slow sales of the \u00a0Galaxy S9 would dampen earnings this quarter. He expects the Samsung to ship about 31 million Galaxy S9 handsets in 2018. That number falls far below Samsung\u2019s sales target of <a href=\"http://www.theinvestor.co.kr/view.php?ud=20180312000687\">43 million Galaxy S9</a> handsets.</p>",
            "<p>In addition to slow sales for the Galaxy S9, Samsung also stated softer sales on smartphone displays affected overall earnings for the quarter. In its quarterly statement Samsung reported that \u201cweak demand for flexible OLED panels in the second quarter while the shipment and price for LCD panels also fell.\u201d Additionally, Apple\u2019s reported decision to shift more handsets from OLED displays to LCDs may have have something to do with the slump.</p>",
            "<p>The company was boosted however by strong sales of memory chips. Samsung Electronics became the <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/samsung-passes-intel-as-worlds-no-1-chip-maker-2017-07-30\">No. 1 supplier of semiconductors</a> worldwide in 2017 and its sales of memory chips continue to outpace its competitors by a long distance. Strong demand for DRAM chips and NAND flash memory helped the company improve its quarter overall.</p>",
            "<p>Samsung may see a boost in fourth-quarter sales, though. The company is expected to announce new hardware in August, including the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-note-9-news/\">Galaxy Note 9</a>, <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-news/\">Samsung Gear S4</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-tab-s4-news/\">Samsung Galaxy Tab S4</a>. The products would likely go on sale during the third quarter, giving an extra bump to sales before the holiday season starts.</p>"
