            "<p>The iPhone X <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-x-review/\">launched to stellar reviews</a> and equally strong sales, but Fast Company is reporting that <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40564691/source-apple-will-produce-only-8-million-iphone-x-units-in-q2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">demand has slowed considerably</a>. A source within Apple\u2019s supply chains has said that the company plans to make a mere eight million units for the second quarter of this year.</p>",
            "<p>Part of the problem stems from the simple fact that the rush of holiday sales convinced Apple to produce too many iPhone X units and now needs to \u201cburn off\u201d its supply. In total, Apple sold more than 77 million iPhones during the 2017 holiday season. Tim Cook has said that the iPhone X outsold all other models every week of the first quarter since its release. This tracks with\u00a0Above Avalon analyst Neil Cybart\u2019s estimate that the iPhone X accounted for about 35 percent of all smartphone sales during the holiday season.</p>",
            "<p>Demand for the device has slowed down considerably since then, however, and Apple\u2019s supply chain reflects this new reality.\u00a0TSMC, which produces many of the chips used in the iPhone X, warned investors of falling demand for its chips. Analysts expected TSMC to earn about $8.8 billion, but the company\u2019s quarterly guidance reports say that number is closed to $7.8 to $7.9 billion.</p>",
            "<p>Australia-based AMS, which makes some of the components used in Apple\u2019s facial recognition system, warned that it expects its second-quarter revenue to be half what it was in the first.</p>",
            "<p>Internally, there are reports that some within Apple are disappointed in the iPhone X sales and have questioned the wisdom of releasing a $1,000 smartphone. This mindset may help determine Apple\u2019s game plan for 2018. The company is expected to release three new iPhones this year, <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/iphone-xs-iphone-xs-max-iphone-xr-news/\">including a 6.1-inch LCD model</a>.</p>",
            "<p>The LCD phone could be priced as low as $550. Some sources within Apple say that the company expects this more affordable iPhone to account for as much as 50 percent of unit sales once it is launched.</p>",
            "<p>None of this means that the iPhone X is a failure. Cybart estimates that, by the time the 2018 iPhones launch, the iPhone X will have sold 60 million\u00a0units and earned Apple $59 billion in revenue. There are plenty of companies that would love to have that level of \u201cdisappointment.\u201d</p>"

            "<p>When it comes to high-quality devices, like the iPad, MacBook, HomePod, or Apple Watch, people seem to either love them or hate them. The popularity of these sleek devices endures, however. This is undoubtedly owed to the excellent build quality of Apple hardware, as well as the devices\u2019 sleek modern aesthetics, highly functional and intuitive software, and the company\u2019s reputation for delivering \u201cfashionable\u201d tech. A new iPhone can cost you a pretty penny, though, which is one of the reasons that Android <a href=\"https://www.cultofmac.com/442781/ios-falls-as-androids-market-share-skyrockets/\" rel=\"noopener\">still commands the lion\u2019s share of the smartphone market</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Nonetheless, the venerable iPhone still enjoys royal status in the world of smart tech. <a href=\"https://www.cultofmac.com/488454/ios-evolution-iphone-os/\" rel=\"noopener\">If you\u2019ve just gotta have iOS</a> (and aren\u2019t the type to wait in line to pay in store prices on launch day),\u00a0 then you\u2019re not out of luck. Seasonal deals and new product rollouts offer a lot of chances to score some deep discounts on your cell phone. To keep you up to date with the latest offers, promo codes, and cell phone plans, we\u2019ve curated an up-to-date list of the best iPhone deals and cheap iPhone options for January:</p>",
            "<p>The iPhone SE was designed as a downsized and less costly alternative to its cousins, making it the best iPhone option for buyers who want an affordable iOS device. The SE model has a lot more going for it than its low price, however, as it\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-se-review/\">a fantastic little wireless phone</a> in its own right. Though you may need to hold off an downloading an app or two.</p>",
            "<p>The SE was first introduced in 2016. Its compact frame sports a four-inch display, harking back to the older model iPhones. Plus It runs on hardware similar to the iPhone 6, and features a 1.85 GHz dual-core CPU and 2GB of RAM. It often comes in Rose Gold or Space Gray, but if you don\u2019t like either of those classic iPhone colors, you can always cover it up with an iPhone case.</p>",
            "<p>With a retail price of $399, which is shockingly low when it comes to iPhones \u2013 the SE is hands down <a href=\"https://www.cultofmac.com/420686/iphone-se-proves-size-doesnt-matter-reviews/\" rel=\"noopener\">the go-to budget pick</a>. We\u2019re all about those smartphone deals, though, so you can pay even less with the following cheap iPhone discounts you won\u2019t find in a store. Whether you chose a phone plan with unlimited minutes, unlimited texts, or unlimited GB data is entirely up to you, however.</p>",

Its 2015 successor, the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-6s-review/\">fantastic iPhone 6S</a>, also proved immensely successful, with record-breaking launch sales.

It also performs similarly to the iPhone X when it comes to its excellent camera and speedy wireless charging, also akin to a newer Galaxy phone. Since the battery life is also similar, the main difference between the iPhone 8 and the iPhone X is screen size and a touch screen home button, but you can still get both in that classic Space Gray color you know and love.</p>",
            "<p>Although its more traditional design <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-8-review/\">isn\u2019t as groundbreaking as iPhones of the past</a>, the iPhone 8 still delivers the solid build quality and performance we\u2019ve come to expect. Plus with a starting retail price of $699 for this iPhone and a $799 price tag for the iPhone 8 Plus, as well as that classic Space Gray finish, it\u2019s not quite as pricey as the X. If you\u2019re looking for a great phone, but don\u2019t feel like making monthly payments to upgrade to the newest model, you can save some cash with these ongoing Apple iPhone 8 deals and GSM carrier sales:</p>",

It\u2019s the first iPhone to boast a stunning OLED screen, as well as the first to do away the iconic home button. </span></p>",
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But like any smartphone, there are always a few issues that crop up. We\u2019ve compiled a list of\u00a0iPhone X\u00a0problems, after scouring through support threads and forums, and we also have fixes and workarounds to make sure your new iPhone keeps working perfectly.</span></p>",
            "<p>People have quickly gotten used to unlocking their iPhones with their faces, but it seems that Face ID has not been performing perfectly for everyone.

This issue may crop up after a software update.</p>",
            "<p>We\u2019ve seen a few reports at the <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8214240\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple</a> <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8222365\" rel=\"noopener\">forums</a> and the <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-x-screen-staying-on.2085795/\" rel=\"noopener\">MacRumors forum</a> about the iPhone X screen refusing to turn back on, refusing to turn off, or freezing up intermittently. There are a few possible causes of this.</p>",
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shortly after the release of the iPhone X, Apple put out a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208191\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> about the OLED display used in the phone. The company noted that over time, \u201cimage persistence\u201d or \u201cburn-in\u201d could appear.\u00a0</span>Burn-in occurs when a static image is left on the screen for a long time and gets burned into the display permanently. For example, if you leave your iPhone X screen on for quite a while sitting on the home screen, the icon of an app may get burned into the screen, so much so that you can see its faint outline when watching a video.</p>",
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple is being proactive here and warning users that burn-in could occur on the iPhone X in the future, as OLED screens are <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-addresses-pixel-2-xl-screen-burn-in/\">often prone</a> to the problem, but it\u2019s not likely to happen to most people.</span></p>",
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A number of users on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/7bnann/iphone_x_screen_not_responsive_in_the_cold/\">Reddit</a> have reported that the iPhone X stops working when they are in cold temperatures. The problem typically only lasts a few seconds, though some users have experienced a longer freeze-up. Luckily, Apple is aware of the problem and is working on a software update that should address the issue.</span></p>",
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple Insider </span><a href=\"http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/11/10/some-iphone-x-owners-report-mystery-green-lines-appearing-on-displays\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reports </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a small number of iPhone X users see a persistent green line on the left or right side of the screen. People who have experienced the issue say the line does not appear when you first turn on the phone, but after using it. Samsung, the manufacturer of the iPhone X display, had a similar problem with the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/galaxy-s7-edge-problems/\">Samsung Galaxy S7</a>, leading people to believe this may be a hardware problem.</span></p>",
            "<p>Posts in the <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8289339\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple forums</a>, on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7t58eh/iphone_x_speaker_crackling/\" rel=\"noopener\">Reddit</a>, and in the <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-x-crackle-speakers.2084292/\" rel=\"noopener\">MacRumors forum</a> describe a crackling noise when iPhone X speakers are at a high volume.

A similar problem on the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/common-iphone-8-problems-and-how-to-fix-them/\">iPhone 8</a> was attributed to a software issue and a patch was released to address the problem.

            "<p>The initial estimates, set during the November launch window of the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/go/3a1390a407196eecdfb07e2e78841104bbde8bbc/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" class=\" h-affiliate-link trackable\" data-event-type=\"affiliate-click\" data-event-action=\"manual\" data-event-param=\"Apple\">iPhone X</a>, were for 40 million\u00a0units. According to Nikkei\u2019s unsourced report, the company informed suppliers that the number has been revised to 20 million units after international sales during the holiday season were less than anticipated. Not long after the news broke on Nikkei, the stock market responded to the news and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/29/apple-falls-as-iphone-x-order-cut-reports-mount.html\">Apple\u2019s share prices fell 1.9 percent</a> \u2014 a loss of $45 billion.</p>",
            "<p>This isn\u2019t the first we\u2019ve heard of issues surrounding the iPhone X. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/iphone-x-end-of-life/\">an analyst from KGI Securities</a> predicted that the iPhone X would be permanently retired in the summer of 2018, following sales that were less than expected.</p>",
            "<p>Interestingly, production numbers for the iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and iPhone 7 have not been altered, with Apple still expecting to maintain a production target of 30 million units for the cheaper, less advanced models. This tallies with <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/iphone-x-sales/\">another previous report from analysts Cowen &amp; Co.</a> that customers preferred cheaper iPhones to the more expensive iPhone X\u00a0and blamed the extremely high $999 iPhone X price tag as the reason that many Apple consumers were gravitating to the other models.</p>",
            "<p>The reason for the high price tag is likely for a handful of reasons. Apple\u2019s iPhone has always been a premium brand but the iPhone X broke new ground even in that marketplace. <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Apple-to-halve-iPhone-X-production-in-1Q\">Most commentators</a> point to the price of OLED displays as being a large part of the reason that the iPhone X\u2019s price was so inflated above the market average. The OLED screen on the iPhone X was Apple\u2019s first, and with mobile competitor Samsung being the only supplier who could supply enough displays for Apple\u2019s needs, the iPhone giant would have likely been paying <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-makes-billions-from-iphone-x-displays/\">top dollar for each display</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Regardless of this news, Apple\u2019s iPhones continued to sell well toward\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/iphone-8-iphone-7-sales-apple/\">the tail end of 2017</a>. While $45 billion may also be a large sum of money, it\u2019s not a massive relative drop for Apple, which is on track to becoming the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-1-trillion/\">world\u2019s first company valued at $1 trillion</a>.</p>"

Apple took a surprising turn when it also revealed a third device this year, the iPhone XR, with a starting price of only $750, and Verizon customers (or those willing to switch) can even score one for free. Read on to find out how.</p>",
            "<p>Brand-name flagships are typically released in two variants: A standard-sized smartphone and a second oversized one with a larger display, and the iPhone XS and XS Max followed this model. It seems that the designers at Apple headquarters have been paying attention to consumer demand for less expensive flagships, though, and so we saw the Cupertino, California-based company also roll out the iPhone XR as a third and more affordable alternative to the very pricey XS.</p>",
            "<p>The iPhone XR\u2019s hardware isn\u2019t quite as good as that of its beefier (and more expensive) siblings, but it still boasts <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-xr-review/\">excellent flagship-like specs for a competitive price</a>.

            "<p>Note that this discount comes in the form of a rebate via bill credits, so you\u2019ll need to buy both phones first and then you\u2019ll receive the cost of the iPhone XR ($750) back over 24 months.

With so many amazing features, you want to use your <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-x-review/\">iPhone X</a> without worrying about battery life. There\u2019s an easy way to make sure you never come up short \u2014 just invest in a battery case for when you need power the most.</p>",

            "<p>Battery cases are bound to add some bulk to your slim phone\u00a0because adding extra battery also means extra mass. This battery case from ZeroLemon adds an extra 12 hours of talk time to your iPhone X, and thanks to the slim profile, doesn\u2019t add too much bulk. It\u2019s easy to attach, with a slide-and-lock design, and a series of four LEDs that let you know the case\u2019s charge level. Charging the case and syncing your phone to your PC is possible with a USB-C cable, so you won\u2019t need to remove the case to charge it. ZeroLemon has also upgraded the original battery case\u00a0and added a screen protector. The downsides? The additional chin at the bottom of the case ruins your phone\u2019s edgeless display, it blocks wireless charging, and there\u2019s no audio via wired headphones \u2014 Bluetooth only. Still, for $40, this provides a lot of extra juice.</p>",

            "<p>Another great choice for an all-around battery case, this wireless charging-enabled Alpatronix case adds a great amount of extra capacity in a subtle shell. Specially programmed to charge the phone first and the case second, it\u2019s perfect for anyone who can\u2019t bear to give up their new wireless charger for extra battery capacity. The 4,200mAh-rated battery should provide at least 12 extra hours of talk time, and the design will provide some protection against drops and bumps. The downsides? The case charges by Micro USB connection, and while you can still connect to your PC with that, that means no Lightning headphones. It\u2019s also fairly bulky, adding a sizeable chin to the bottom of the device. Still, this is a solid battery case \u2014 oh, and it comes with a free <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-iphone-x-screen-protectors/\">iPhone X tempered glass screen protector</a> too.</p>",

Thankfully, Feekea has come up with a battery case with the added convenience of a power bank. This case comes in two parts: A thin, protective case, and a power bank that attaches magnetically to the case \u2014 and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/does-wireless-charging-degrade-your-battery-faster/\">charges your phone wirelessly</a>. An extra 5,000mAh\u00a0 capacity is a lot, and it should add up to 27 hours of extra call time. The power bank itself charges by Lightning cable \u2014 so you only need to carry the one charging cable for your phone and case. The case comes with a raised bezel to protect your phone, as well as a kickstand. This is a great case if you like battery cases, but don\u2019t like the added weight and heft.</p>",

            "<p>The iPhone X is a remarkable phone, but it\u2019s probably best known for the bezel-free, chin-less design that sets it apart from its peers. When looking at battery cases, you might notice that a lot of them add an unattractive extra chin to the bottom of the device. That\u2019s to house the connection to the Lightning port most of the time, but it\u2019s still not something you want when you buy a phone like the iPhone X. The Tech Care battery case avoids that chin, and adds an amazing 6,000mAh of extra battery in the process \u2014 enough for an additional 28 hours of talk time. It\u2019ll charge with your existing Lightning cable, but unfortunately will only support Bluetooth headphones. Despite that, it still adds 200 percent extra battery and displays your remaining charge on the rear side of the case with a set of LEDs that form a little smile. Aww.</p>",

            "<p>Batteries can be fragile and volatile things, so we\u2019d usually never recommend relying on a case\u2019s protective qualities where a battery is concerned. However, this rugged battery case from Smiphee certainly seems to break that mold. It utilizes a more rugged design than most battery cases, with plenty of edges to enhance grip and elevate your phone away from grit and dirt on surfaces. There\u2019s also a series of rugged airbags on each corner to help withstand impacts. Most importantly, it comes with 4,000mAh of extra power \u2014 enough for an additional 21 hours of talk time. It charges via Lightning cable, just like your phone, and it doesn\u2019t restrict you to just using Bluetooth headphones, so feel free to plug in your Lightning headphones at any time.</p>",

We\u2019ll clear something out the way first, though \u2014 it\u2019s IP67-rated, so it has the same level of water-resistance you already get in the iPhone X. You can\u2019t take it snorkeling, but it should be fine if it gets dropped in the bath or in a puddle \u2014 just make sure to fish it out and dry it off properly afterwards. The case adds a decent 3,400mAh capacity to your iPhone X \u2014 about 20 hours talk time \u2014 and though it isn\u2019t the slimmest case on this list, it adds some decent drop protection too. You can charge wirelessly through it, and it\u2019ll let you charge and sync through the case as well.</p>",

The big draw here though is the restoration of an old classic, which some probably still miss \u2014 the 3.5mm headphone jack. Even better, the AudioMod even comes with a built-in DAC to boost your headphone\u2019s prowess. The case itself is slim and lightweight \u2014 though it does add the dreaded battery case chin \u2014 and it comes with a series of LEDs on the back to make sure you know when it\u2019s time to recharge. If you miss the humble headphone jack and need that extra boost of power, the AudioMod is an expensive piece of kit, but one that might be worth it.</p>",

            "<p>Last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/ios-11-review/\">iOS 11 update</a> added a little more customizability into the iPhone and iPad. It changed the way we interact with our Apple devices, but not significantly. <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/ios-12-features-release-date/\">iOS 12</a> takes it all to the next level. We\u2019ve spent most of the summer using Apple\u2019s beta program, and from grouped notifications to Siri Suggestions, iOS 12 helps make the iPhone a little more intelligent, and fixes a few pain points we\u2019ve had with the operating system.</p>",
            "<p>With the new OS, behavior on your iPhone is significant to the way the operating system works. As with any artificial intelligence, the more you use it, the better it will work. Since you use your iPhone on a daily basis, it doesn\u2019t require extra effort either. Slowly, but surely, you\u2019ll find suggested apps to use, people to text back, reminders to attend or book certain events, and more. The process of training your iPhone to adapt to your lifestyle is simple with iOS 12.</p>",
            "<p>Apple\u2019s primary goal with iOS 12 is to deliver an OS that\u2019s faster and more responsive across all devices \u2014 new and old \u2014 which is why the update <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/ios-12-compatible-devices/\">works on more iPhone and iPad devices</a> than ever before. This means ramping up CPU performance to its highest state for performance and ramping it down to preserve battery life. Other improvements include animations that are smoother and faster.</p>",
            "<p>You should notice decent performance boosts on older iPhones \u2014 we certainly did. We installed the beta on an iPhone 6S and an iPhone 7 Plus, and performance was fluid and fast. If you\u2019re still having issues, it could be <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-iphone-battery-performance-dip/\">due to your battery efficiency</a>. You may want to take your device to an Apple Store and replace the battery.</p>",
            "<p>With each iOS 12 beta update, we did see a slight improvement with battery life. On the last developer beta, our 7 Plus managed to last a little bit longer with 27 percent remaining at 5:45 p.m. \u2014 lasting us throughout the entirety of a typical work day.</p>",
            "<p>With the final version of iOS 12, we found that our battery lasted only a little bit longer. After taking it off the charger at 8:30 a.m., it was at 86 percent by 10 a.m. By noon, it was at 56 percent (having taken a phone call) and at the end of our workday at 6 p.m it was at 16 percent. To be fair, it\u2019s definitely a step up from when we used our iPhone 7 Plus with iOS 11 last year \u2014 which would reach about one percent by the early afternoon.</p>",
            "<p>But with Apple\u2019s new A12 Bionic chip featured on its latest lineup of iPhones, it shouldn\u2019t wear down the battery nearly as much. Apple says you\u2019ll get 30 minutes more time from the iPhone X on the XS while the XS Max will have 90 minutes more. As for <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-iphone-xr-news/\">the iPhone XR</a>, it should last an hour and a half more than the iPhone 8 Plus.</p>",
            "<p>After taking our iPhone XS off the charger at 7:45 a.m. at 100 percent, it was at 57 percent by 4 p.m. \u2014 this was after using it for text messaging, social media, and listening to Spotify while getting ready for the day.\u00a0It was at 14 percent by the time we were getting ready for bed at 9 p.m. (having made a few quick phone calls), meaning it lasted us almost 12 hours before having to put it back on the charger. For a long day filled with notifications, social media, phone calls, and music streaming, we\u2019d say a full day worth of battery life is plenty.</p>",
            "<p>Every iPhone or iPad user is familiar with the endless list of notifications on the lockscreen. Scattered text messages, news bulletins, social media notifications, emails \u2014 it\u2019s tough navigating and staying on top of alerts. If the same person texted you multiple times, you\u2019d have to scroll up and down to piece together what was said, or simply jump into the app.</p>",
            "<p>Thankfully, Apple is taking a feature from Android we\u2019ve loved for a long time \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/ios-12-notifications-update/\">grouped notifications</a>. Everything is neatly organized in stacks based on the type of notification or app. It dramatically improves the iOS experience, and allows us to look at each stack based on importance rather than having to sort through them all.</p>",
            "<p>You can also choose which notifications you want to turn off from the lockscreen, which is a nice way to control the barrage of notifications throughout your day. When you receive a notification, swipe to the left and tap on<em> Manage</em>, which allows you to turn them off completely. Alternatively, you can tap on <em>Deliver Quietly,</em> and the notification will appear in the Notification Center but not on the lockscreen.</p>",
            "<p>We can\u2019t imagine going back to the way iOS used to handle notifications; it\u2019s so much less work to sift through them now.</p>",
            "<p>When Do Not Disturb was first introduced, there weren\u2019t any customization options other than the ability to toggle it on and off. With iOS 12, it\u2019s now possible to set specific time frames for it to automatically kick in and turn off without having to worry about doing it manually.</p>",
            "<p>The one feature we were most excited to try was Do Not Disturb during bedtime mode, which prevents notifications from popping up on the lock screen during scheduled times. When it\u2019s turned on, a notification sits on your lockscreen letting you know it\u2019s on, and that all notifications and calls will be silenced and hidden. We\u2019ve grown quite fond of it.</p>",
            "<p>At 10 p.m. each night, our display goes dim and stays silent throughout the entire night until 7 a.m. the next morning. We\u2019re trying to fall asleep, and not having to see our display flashing or hear our phone vibrating is relieving \u2014 we look forward to it every night. It has also kicked our habit of constantly checking notifications throughout the night.</p>",
            "<p>When bedtime Do Not Disturb ends, the \u201cgood morning\u201d greeting that pops up on the lock screen with the weather is a nice touch, and a good way to start the day.</p>",
            "<p><a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/technology-addiction-concern-controversy-and-finding-balance-infographic\">Smartphone addiction</a> has been a growing topic of discussion over the years, but more so in 2018. Both Apple and Google <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-screen-time-and-google-digital-wellbeing/\">have added tools</a> in their respective operating system updates this year to address increasingly high smartphone usage. iOS 12 adds a new section in the Settings app called Screen Time. It offers a summary of your smartphone use, and the ability to set time limits on specific apps.</p>",
            "<p>We were happy to see the feature and were surprised to see our smartphone usage statistics \u2014 such as how many times we pick up our phone per hour \u2014 but the curiosity quickly wears off. It didn\u2019t really make us want to change our habits. Sometimes we\u2019d receive alerts that provide a summary of our Screen Time for the week. Call it denial, but we rarely ever tapped on it to view the results. It\u2019s become a notification that we almost always clear from our lockscreen instead.</p>",
            "<p>With App Limits \u2014 which allow you to set a limit for how long you can use an app \u2014 it\u2019s extremely easy to override the limit. The option to either turn off the restriction or delay it is offered to you via a pop-up, without having to take extra steps to get to your Settings.</p>",
            "<p>We did try to set App Limits to restrict our social media usage, but it only worked for about 10 minutes before we gave up on our attempt to stay off Instagram. It\u2019s too easy to ignore App Limits.</p>",
            "<p>When we first started using Screen Time, we wanted to set limits for apps individually like on <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-android-p-news/\">Android 9 Pie</a>, rather than have them bundled together by category (Social Media, Entertainment, Productivity, etc.). But after using the feature for a while, grouping all the apps together is the more productive approach. That way, you can attempt to condition yourself to stay off all social media apps or all entertainment apps. If you\u2019re set on specific apps that you absolutely need at all times, you can add them to the \u201cAlways Allowed\u201d category.</p>",
            "<p>The \u201cDowntime\u201d feature allows you to schedule a window of time where notifications are disabled \u2014 similar to Do Not Disturb at bedtime. The idea is to make sure work-related apps don\u2019t disturb you when you\u2019re at home, for example, and it works well enough. As with App Limits and Screen Time, Downtime requires personal restraint, because otherwise it\u2019s easy to continue your old habits.</p>",
            "<p>We do wish we could also schedule a window of time with App Limits, the way we can with Downtime. Right now, all you can do is customize the days you want app limits to turn on and the amount of time you\u2019d like for it to be enabled. It\u2019d be more useful if we could set it to specific times each day that we know we don\u2019t want to be on certain apps.</p>",
            "<p>Siri is finally a little more useful in iOS 12. With Siri Shortcuts, the voice assistant is capable of much more via quick actions that can all be assigned through the new Shortcuts app. There isn\u2019t much you can do at the moment other than customize voice commands to trigger a specific action. For instance, by telling Siri our home address (or whatever phrase you want), we can have the Lyft app launch immediately.</p>",
            "<p>One of our favorite improvements to Siri is Siri Suggestions. Since we already use the Spotlight Search tool on a daily basis to access certain apps, suggestions conveniently show up underneath and they\u2019re genuinely helpful.</p>",
            "<p>If we\u2019re having a conversation with a friend via text and either haven\u2019t responded or tend to text them more often than others, Siri suggests to send a message. When we missed a phone call from a family member, we received a suggestion to make a call back.</p>",
            "<p>We\u2019ve become so reliant on Siri Suggestions, especially on extra busy days when there\u2019s a lot on our mind, and Siri gives us that helpful reminder to call our parents back or answer a friend\u2019s text message.</p>",
            "<p>When planning lunch or dinner plans via iMessage, it\u2019ll also suggest adding the event to your calendar. These buttons are one click actions, so it doesn\u2019t require much effort to follow through on Siri\u2019s suggestions, which is handy.</p>",
            "<p>You can also customize where you\u2019d like Siri Suggestions to appear. Go to <em>Settings &gt; Siri &amp; Search</em> and scroll towards the bottom. From there, you can choose to toggle off <em>Suggestions in Search</em>, <em>Suggestions in Look Up</em>, or <em>Suggestions on Lock Screen</em> \u2014 all depending on your preference.</p>",
            "<p>Even though Siri\u2019s ability to transcribe hasn\u2019t gotten any better in iOS 12, we\u2019re happy to see it\u2019s able to make itself useful in a meaningful way.</p>",
            "<p>Apple <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-use-the-measure-app-in-ios-12/\">introduced a new app called Measure</a>\u00a0 \u2014 an app that utilizes ARKit 2.0 to identify the distance between objects and spaces in the real world with the phone\u2019s camera. While the app still recommends to use a tape measure or measuring stick for precise measurements, we found it to be quite accurate if you need a rough estimate. It\u2019s one of those apps you\u2019ll only use for specific instances, though.</p>",
            "<p>The Photos app also received a few upgrades. With a new \u201cFor You\u201d tab, photos are all organized based on highlights. Whether it was a concert in Philadelphia or a trip to Spain, the tab neatly places them into albums to look through. What we like more is the improved search, where we can look up specific venues or places to find our photos much faster.</p>",
            "<p>A few other apps got some love in this update. The Stocks app, which most people probably uninstall, now has Apple News built in. For those interested in finance, the redesign makes it easy to check on stocks while simultaneously reading through the news of the day. We also like how sleek it looks in comparison to the somewhat bland Stocks app before it.</p>",
            "<p>The Voice Memo app also has a new look that makes it more\u00a0 contemporary. With the new version, the record button is at the bottom while past recordings are listed at the top \u2014 which makes it more comfortable and intuitive to use. You can also swipe up so the recorder is full screen, where there\u2019s also the option to trim the audio.</p>",
            "<p>Following the abundance of iMessage features Apple released with iOS 10, we were bummed that iOS 11 failed to include any fun features. Thankfully, iOS 12 redeems itself with a few new capabilities. Not only can you create a Memoji of yourself through a quick and simple process, but you can also use them as stickers within the camera app on iMessage. Granted, you will need an iPhone X or later to utilize this feature.</p>",
            "<p>For those stuck on iPhone 8, 8 Plus, or earlier devices, there\u2019s still fun you can have through iMessage. Tap the star icon in the camera app, and it\u2019ll automatically bring you to selfie mode and let you to add stickers (depending on the sticker packs you download), text, filters, and shapes to your photos. It\u2019s very similar to Snapchat or Facebook Messenger\u2019s camera, and it\u2019s handy to have built into iMessage.</p>",
            "<p>One minor tweak we\u2019ve finally gotten used to is the Photos app, which is now located in the app drawer in iMessage. Rather than having to send photos through iMessage by tapping on the camera button and then on your photo album, iOS 12 makes it easier to access with one less step. The drawer will show all of your recent photos, and tapping on \u2018All Photos\u2019 in the right-hand corner will bring you to your entire photo album within the iMessage window to easily choose and send one over.</p>",
            "<p>Those with an iPhone X, <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-xs-review/\">iPhone XS</a>, XS Max, or XR, also now have access to Animojis and iOS 12\u2019s new <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-make-a-memoji/\">Memojis</a>. Using the TrueDepth camera on the front, you can now create Animojis that look just like you. You have the ability to customize the physical traits like eyes and hair, along with accessories like earrings and glasses. Since it mirrors your muscle movements, you can record 30-second videos with your Memoji to then send and replay within iMessage conversations.</p>",
            "<p>Let\u2019s face it, memorizing all our passwords for the tons of accounts on our phone can be tough. With iOS 12, the new Passwords &amp; Accounts section allows you to save any password you\u2019d like.</p>",
            "<p>Any password you save to your phone will autofill the username and password fields \u2014 that way, you don\u2019t have to type it in manually or run the risk of forgetting it completely.</p>",
            "<p>Google introduced a similar feature in Android 8 Oreo, and we\u2019re thrilled Apple has done the same. It\u2019s convenient to have it built into the operating system. Any time we\u2019re typing in a password, a notification appears that allows us to either save a new one or use an existing username and password \u2014 all with one tap.</p>",
            "<p>All of your passwords are logged in one place within your Settings and the list is neatly organized whenever you want to reference it.</p>",
            "<p>With iOS 12, Apple brings along necessary improvements that were missing in <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/ios-11-review/\">iOS 11</a>. This time around, the changes are much bigger \u2014 with more complex features that help make the user experience more fluid.\u00a0 Thanks to machine learning, the iPhone learns your behavioral patterns and adapts over time, making it easier to get simple things done.</p>",
            "<p>But it also helps remind you that it\u2019s important to take some time away from your phone as well. While its up to you to keep up with setting boundaries, Screen Time and Do Not Disturb are extremely useful tools in iOS 12 that can help you manage time on your smartphone better.</p>",
            "<p>On the iPad, iOS 12 requires using the exact same gestures as you would on the iPhone X. According to rumors, it\u2019s been said that Apple does plan on removing the home button from the iPad in the future, so the gestures might make more sense soon. But on our iPad Mini, it felt a little foreign at first \u2014 especially since we were used to our iPhone 8 Plus.</p>",
            "<p>After a while though, we found ourselves accustomed to navigating the device. Without a notch, it might be tough to pinpoint exactly where to swipe down but the display is responsive enough that as long as you swipe down to the right or left, it\u2019ll pull down the specific menu.\u00a0As with the iPhone X, you\u2019ll have to swipe down on the left side of the device to access the notification page and on the right side for the Control Center.\u00a0Overall, the OS felt fluid on the iPad Mini and we didn\u2019t find there was any lag or performance issues.</p>",
            "<p>To <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-get-ios-12/\">download iOS 12</a> on your device, simply go to <em>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</em>. You may have to clear out some data first to allow it to download the update. Don\u2019t forget to back up to the cloud, and make sure your device is compatible.</p>",

            "<p>Reports may suggest that Apple wasn\u2019t all that impressed with sales of the iPhone X toward the end of last year, but in the last quarter, it hit a pretty massive milestone when it comes to smartphone sales. According to a <a href=\"https://www.strategyanalytics.com/strategy-analytics/news/strategy-analytics-press-releases/strategy-analytics-press-release/2018/02/15/strategy-analytics-apple-iphone-takes-huge-51-percent-share-of-global-smartphone-revenues-in-q4-2017#.Wocd1hPwaF1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report from Strategy Analytics</a>, Apple raked in more than half of all smartphone market revenue.</p>",
            "<p>Apple took in $61.4 billion (51 percent) of smartphone revenue, followed very distantly by Samsung. Samsung\u2019s $18.9 billion in smartphone revenue last quarter, which ended December 31, equates to around 15.7 percent. In third place is Huawei, which made $8.4 billion (7 percent). After that, Strategy Analytics simply lists every other company as \u201cothers\u201d; those companies account for 26.2 percent of the market.</p>",
            "<p>Contrary to previous reports, and according to Strategy Analytics, the huge revenue was due to \u201csolid demand\u201d for the iPhone X. The average price of the iPhone went up to a hefty $796, up from $695 in the same quarter last year. That makes sense considering the $1,000 base price of the iPhone X, which is Apple\u2019s new flagship model.</p>",
            "<p>China in particular is an increasingly important market for Apple. While Android fans in China have a range of companies to choose from, those who buy iPhones in the country are generally dedicated Apple fans, according to a new <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40531950/iphone-x-remains-strong-in-china-but-mid-range-chinese-phones-hurt-overall-iphone-sales-says-analyst\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report from Fast Company</a>. Still, only 3 percent of activated iPhones in China are the iPhone X. Just 2.63 percent are the iPhone 8 Plus, and 1.36 percent are the iPhone 8. That means the vast majority of people are still using older iPhone models \u2014 though that\u2019s to be expected.</p>",
            "<p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/02/15/apple-inc-just-hit-a-ridiculously-impressive-miles.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report from The Motley Fool</a>, Strategy Analytics\u2019 revenue forecast is slightly different from Apple\u2019s. Strategy Analytics notes Apple made $61.4 billion, while Apple\u2019s official figures come in at $61.6 billion \u2014 though that\u2019s apparently because Strategy Analytics\u2019 report doesn\u2019t count wholesale revenues.</p>",

            "<p>Apple and Samsung are major rivals in the smartphone space, so one might expect that the latter would be pleased to hear of the weak demand for the iPhone X. However, it turns out that Samsung <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-makes-billions-from-iphone-x-displays/\">provided the OLED displays</a> for the iPhone X, and Nikkei Asian Review reports that those low sales have sent the South Korean electronics giant\u00a0<a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/OLED-panel-glut-looms-as-Apple-slashes-iPhone-X-production\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">looking for new buyers</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Samsung increased its production of the OLED panels in order to meet Apple\u2019s expected demand, but lackluster sales of the iPhone X have left Samsung with a surplus of OLED panels and few buyers. Samsung was likely hoping that other smartphone makers would transition to OLED displays, but many are choosing to go with the less expensive LCD displays.</p>",
            "<p>Many of the major Chinese smartphone companies focus on the mid-range market, and few of them can afford to make extensiveuse of OLED displays. Roughly 5 to 10 percent of smartphones made by Oppo and Vivo make use of OLED displays. The problem is, once again, the cost. These panels can cost, on average, 40 percent more than LCD displays. Given that the budget and mid-range smartphone markets often compete on price, it is understandable that many would prefer to go for the cheaper panels.</p>",
            "<p>Cost appears to be the major issue for Samsung\u2019s OLED displays. The panels offer bright colors and can be bent to narrow a phone\u2019s bezels, but these displays can cost more than a $100, which is more than twice what the company\u2019s LCD displays cost. The high price of the OLED displays were part of the reason the iPhone X retailed for $1,000.</p>",
            "<p>The expensive OLED displays are also causing trouble for Samsung\u2019s own smartphone division. Not all of its phones make use of the pricey panels, but its flagship models do. IHS Market, a British research firm, noted that Samsung\u2019s internal use of OLED panels declined in 2017.</p>",
            "<p>Worst of all for Samsung is that its market dominance may be coming to an end. The company currently controls 95 percent of the OLED market, but that is likely to change in the coming years. LG Display is preparing to increase production of its own OLED displays. as are Chinese rivals\u00a0BOE Technology Group and Tianma Micro-electronics.</p>"

            "<p>When Apple announced the iPhone X, it was met with a bit of a mixed reaction. On one hand, everyone thought the phone looked amazing, but the $1,000 price tag was a bit much. Despite the phone selling very well during the holiday season, Apple appears to be poised to<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-x-pensive-apple-looks-to-keep-phones-with-cheaper-displays-1529051835\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> focus its efforts on more affordable alternatives this year</a>. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Apple\u2019s supply chains are producing a higher number of LCD panels which are used in Apple\u2019s less expensive smartphones.</p>",
            "<p>Apple itself has not directly commented on its plans for the future and has said that the iPhone X was its best-selling smartphone for the first three months of 2018. That being said, many analysts believe that less expensive LCD-based phones make up the majority of Apple\u2019s sales.</p>",
            "<p>This doesn\u2019t mean that Apple is abandoning the OLED displays found in the iPhone X. In fact, it is widely believed that two of this year\u2019s new iPhones will feature OLED panels, whereas only one will make use of an LCD display. Despite this, it has been reported that Apple\u2019s suppliers are producing more LCD displays than OLED displays because the company expects that most consumers will prefer the more affordable option. The OLED panels were a major factor in the high price point of the iPhone X, with some analysts saying they cost about $100 compared to $40 LCD displays used in the iPhone 8.</p>",
            "<p>Regardless of which option consumers choose, they will likely be getting a similar phone to last year\u2019s iPhone X, as it is believed that Apple intends to use the X\u2019s design as the basis for 2018\u2019s smartphones.</p>",
            "<p>If that is true, then it may be the end of the line for the design used by the iPhone 8, which has been a staple since the iPhone 6. At this point the design, while certainly iconic, does feel a bit dated. It can often be difficult to tell the iPhone 8 from the 7 or the 6, which makes this change a rather welcome one. Regardless of where you stand on the iOS v Android debate, there can be little doubt that the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-x-review/\">iPhone X is one of the best looking smartphones on the market</a>.</p>"

            "<p>Formerly the most expensive protector on this list, but for a good reason. <a href=\"https://www.whitestonedome.com/products-2/\">Whitestone</a> has been quietly making a name for itself thanks to a range of glass screen protection that\u2019s applied using a unique UV lamp, curing the adhesive beneath and ensuring a perfect bond between the phone and the screen protector. The protector itself is rated at 9H hardness, cuts blue light by 25 percent (helping your eyes), and adds scratch and drop-resistance to your device. Because of the wet application method, touch sensitivity is increased, and any small cracks that develop in the protector will be filled in by the liquid, adding longevity. It can even be applied to a broken screen after the fact \u2014 the liquid runs into the cracks, securing them against any further damage. Perfect!</p>",

            "<p>Apple is being sued over the dual-lens camera tech used to power the exceptionally capable camera suites in the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-x-review/\">iPhone X</a>, <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-8-plus-review/\">iPhone 8 Plus</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-7-plus-review/\">iPhone 7 Plus</a> smartphones.</p>",
            "<p>In a claim that <a href=\"http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2017/11/one-of-the-pioneers-in-dual-camera-technologies-corephotonics-sues-apple-on-four-counts-of-patent-infringement.html\">originated in November 2017</a>, Israeli firm <a href=\"http://corephotonics.com/\">Corephotonics</a> alleges that Apple <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/363778355/1-Corephotonics-vs-Apple-Inc-Patent-Infringement#from_embed\">unlawfully copied its dual-lens technology</a> after being rebuffed for a potential partnership. According to Corephotonics, after Apple refused the offer of an alliance, it then went on to develop its own version of the camera tech anyway. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-patents-lawsuit/israeli-start-up-says-apple-copied-its-patented-smartphone-camera-technology-idUSKBN1D72M0\">According to Reuters</a>, Apple praised the tech during a meeting with Corephotonics Chief Executive David Mendlovic, and after refusing to license it, apparently made a comment that it could simply bypass the patents on the hardware without consequence.</p>",
            "<p>The lawsuit <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/07/israeli-company-claims-apple-copied-its-dual-camera-tech/\">originally only concerned</a> the dual-lens iPhone 7 Plus, but <a href=\"http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2018/05/corephotonics-files-second-patent-infringement-case-against-apple-over-the-iphones-dual-lens-camera.html\">has been expanded</a> to include the other dual-lens camera phones under the Apple iPhone brand \u2014 the iPhone X and the iPhone 8 Plus. Corephotonics\u2019 patents concern the construction of a telephoto zoom within the extremely small confines of a smartphone, and how this technology would interact within a dual-lens system to create a combination of optical and digital zoom.</p>",
            "<p>The crux of the allegation against Apple appears to be that the technology was shown to Apple before Apple then went on to develop its own version \u2014 the implication being that Apple simply lifted the techniques and put them into its own camera designs. Apple has been granted patents for its own cameras.</p>",
            "<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2018/05/corephotonics-files-second-patent-infringement-case-against-apple-over-the-iphones-dual-lens-camera.html\">Patently Apple</a>, one of the patents included in the updated lawsuit was only granted in January 2018 \u2014 after both the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X were released to the public, raising questions of how an ungranted patent was willfully infringed on before it had been granted. Regardless, this may well become a thorny issue for Apple, which is no stranger to lawsuits, having been <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/business/apple-vs-qualcomm-news/\">engaged in multiple legal battles</a> against some of <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-vs-samsung-supreme-court/\">the largest names</a> in the tech industry.</p>"

            "<p>Accessibility options for the physically impaired just got a huge boost, thanks to eBay\u2019s open-source release of its HeadGaze software that allows users to control an <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-x-review/\">iPhone X</a> with simple head movements.</p>",
            "<p>The software only works on the iPhone X at the moment, and uses the phone\u2019s revolutionary <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/apple-patent-faceid-imac/\">FaceID system</a> to track the user\u2019s head movements, and translate them directly onto the screen. The software creates an on-screen cursor that\u2019s then controlled by the user\u2019s movements. Triggering a button or keypress is done by lingering the cursor over the desired button, and users can scroll or turn pages by lingering the cursor on specific parts of the screen. It\u2019s a control scheme that won\u2019t be unfamiliar to anyone who\u2019s used a phone-based virtual reality headset like the Gear VR \u2014 but with the added benefit of not needing a bulky headset.</p>",
            "<p>The technology was created by eBay\u2019s computer team with guidance from PhD candidate and\u00a0eBay intern Muratcan Cicek. While the software hasn\u2019t yet been released on eBay\u2019s app, eBay has <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/289180466\">released a video</a> that shows the software working on the app. In an altruistic move, the auction giant has also released the <a href=\"https://github.com/ebay/HeadGazeLib\">source code on GitHub</a>, so other developers can benefit from the software.</p>",
            "<p>The software is primarily aimed at increasing accessibility options for the physically impaired. It is hoped this software could be incorporated into future mobile operating systems, giving more options to those who may struggle with the touch-based systems currently used in most mobile phones. With a system like HeadGaze, a phone could be held in position while a user uses head movements to browse. Future improvements in voice-based A.I. could also play a role in these accessibility options, helping to open the world of tech to a larger community of people.</p>",
            "<p><a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2018/09/11/ebay-open-sources-headgaze-so-you-can-control-an-iphone-x-screen-with-head-movements/\">Speaking to VentureBeat</a>, Cicek said that the team is working on incorporating other movements into the system, including tracking eye movement. He also pointed out the uses this technology could have beyond the options it offers for the physically impaired, with examples from everyday life.</p>",
            "<p>\u201cTired of trying to scroll through a recipe on your phone screen with greasy fingers while cooking? Too messy to follow the how-to manual on your cell phone while you\u2019re tinkering with the car engine under the hood? Too cold to remove your gloves to use your phone?\u201d</p>",
            "<p>While touchscreens are likely going nowhere for a while yet, it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see some serious developments in this area within the next few years. After all, a lot of us can unlock our phone with our eyes \u2014 why not control it with them, too?</p>"
