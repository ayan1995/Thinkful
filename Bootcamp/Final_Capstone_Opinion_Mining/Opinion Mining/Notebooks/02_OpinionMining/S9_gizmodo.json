            "<p>By now, news has already gotten out about Samsung\u2019s next <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamsungMobile/status/1083377937728950272\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://twitter.com/SamsungMobile/status/1083377937728950272', {metric25:1})\">Unpacked event on Febuary 20th</a>, where we\u2019re expecting to see all three version of the new S10 (S10 Lite, S10, and S10 Plus). But now, a new report from South Korean outlet <a href=\"http://www.etnews.com/20190114000408?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://www.etnews.com/20190114000408?', {metric25:1})\">ETNews</a> suggests that the Samsung S10\u2019s 5G-ready variant will sport some truly far-out hardware.</p>",
            "<p>Dubbed that Galaxy S10 X, ETNews says Samsung\u2019s first 5G-phone will officially go on sale in Korea in late March (shortly after the standard S10 models ship earlier that month) for between 1.6 million and 1.8 million won (around $1,425 to $1,600).</p>",
            "<p>Now that\u2019s some serious cash to throw around for any phone, but if you take a look at some of the Galaxy S10 X\u2019s alleged specs, that $1,500 price tag might not be completely outlandish.</p>",
            "<p>One-upping the rumored S10+\u2019s rumored three-rear cameras, the S10 X will supposedly come with four cameras in back along with two on the front, a massive 6.7-inch AMOLED display, 10GB of RAM along with 1TB of storage, and a 5,000 mAh battery. As for its chipset, it seems the S10 X will come with a Exynos 5100 processor in Korea, though if Samsung\u2019s past Galaxy phones are any indication, that Exynos chip will probably be switched out for a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 if and when the S10 X comes to the U.S.<br></p>",
            "<p>ETNews also says that like the rest of the Galaxy S10 family, the S10 X will feature something called \u201clife pattern mode\u201d that attempts to control and automate certain parts of the phone by using AI to monitor typical usage patterns. That could mean something like automatically closing certain apps the S10 doesn\u2019t think you\u2019ll need again anytime soon or adjust performance to favor the CPU or GPU, which sounds similar to the intelligent tuning Huawei has been doing to its phones for a couple years.</p>",
            "<p>In short, the S10 X\u2019s components read like a wish list for the modern day smartphone fanatic. It\u2019s got big, powerful hardware with a massive battery and the most cameras we\u2019ve seen on a smartphone yet (unless Nokia beat the S10 to market <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/nokias-long-rumored-five-camera-beast-could-get-announ-1831400466\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/nokias-long-rumored-five-camera-beast-could-get-announ-1831400466', {metric25:1})\">with this</a>). And even with the increased battery draw of any 5G-related activities, the S10 X may still offer pretty ridiculous battery life.</p>",
            "<p>After lackluster sales of the Galaxy S9, it feels like<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-cant-afford-to-hold-back-anymore-1831178495\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-cant-afford-to-hold-back-anymore-1831178495', {metric25:1})\"> Samsung has more to prove in 2019 than ever before</a>, and between four new S10 models including that S10 X and its upcoming bendy phone, Samsung just might have what it needs to inject some excitement back into its phones.</p>",

            "<p>It\u2019s been a weird year for Samsung. While the South Korean giant managed to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/09/13/samsung-beats-apple-in-the-global-smartphone-market-as-chinese-brands-close-in/#1ec24357697d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/09/13/samsung-beats-apple-in-the-global-smartphone-market-as-chinese-brands-close-in/#1ec24357697d', {metric25:1})\">hold onto the top spot for global smartphone sales</a>, many of its Chinese rivals started closing the gap with Huawei CEO Richard Yu going so far as to say that <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/03/chinas-huawei-says-it-may-become-the-top-smartphone-maker-by-the-end-of-2019.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/03/chinas-huawei-says-it-may-become-the-top-smartphone-maker-by-the-end-of-2019.html', {metric25:1})\">Huawei could steal the number one spot</a> by as early as 2019. But the bigger issue is that as good as Samsung\u2019s phones were in 2018, so many of its products were overshadowed by things that won\u2019t be available until halfway through next year, <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-first-flexible-phone-could-cost-1-700-and-th-1830381704\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-first-flexible-phone-could-cost-1-700-and-th-1830381704', {metric25:1})\">assuming you can even afford them</a>.<br></p>",
            "<p>At the same time, Samsung\u2019s problems don\u2019t simply boil down to its competition getting better, because many of the company\u2019s issues are self-inflicted. Some of Samsung\u2019s major initiatives still haven\u2019t panned out, and in the ever-evolving smartphone world, Samsung failed to both lean into its strengths <em>and</em> shore up its weaknesses. Here\u2019s what went wrong with the Galaxy in 2018.</p>",
            "<p>By far the biggest issue for Samsung this year is the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944', {metric25:1})\">Galaxy S9</a>, which simply didn\u2019t offer enough improvements to entice the sort of people who buy new phones every year to upgrade. Thanks to Samsung\u2019s foundries, the GS9 was the first phone out sporting a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chip, while Samsung\u2019s display division ensured the GS9 also has the best screen around. But once other phones caught up, what were the GS9's most distinguishing new features? A rear camera with the world\u2019s first dual aperture lens on a smartphone, barely smaller bezels, and funky AR emojis. That\u2019s not nearly enough.</p>",
            "<p>While the camera addict in me loves the nerdy aspect of having dual apertures, the real-world results were just OK. Meanwhile, AR Emoji look like a shitty knock off <a href=\"https://www.bitmoji.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.bitmoji.com/', {metric25:1})\">Bitmoji</a>. But where the hell was the new design. Going back to GS5, Samsung offered noticeably sleeker designs on every phone. The Galaxy S6 ushered in the era of glass sandwich phones, while the S6 Edge featured the world\u2019s first dual-curved display, both of which are design statements that still influence the way phones look today.</p>",
            "<p>Next came the S7, which brought back the S5's water-resistance and microSD card slot and took the S6's style and turned it into something that looked like a sophisticated space pebble. And then came the S8, one of the best-looking phones ever made. Not only did it bring us closer to the bezel-less promised land than ever before, it still left enough room up top for front cams and an iris scanner without needing a notch, it also sported a clever virtual home button in place of the old fingerprint reader.</p>",
            "<p>Then the S9 came out, and it was sort of more of the same. Aside from moving the rear fingerprint sensor to the middle of the phone instead of off to the side (which if we\u2019re honest, was never that big a deal), the S8 and S9 are indistinguishable. To make matters worse, after a year of hate, <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-bixby-button-and-googles-assistant-squeeze-are-1820681623\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-bixby-button-and-googles-assistant-squeeze-are-1820681623', {metric25:1})\">Samsung didn\u2019t get rid of the Bixby button</a> or even make its function customizable. Samsung, if you\u2019re going to put a button on a phone that only does one thing, you better make sure that thing is fucking fantastic. Sadly, as any Samsung phone owner knows, fantastic is one of the last words anyone would use to describe Samsung\u2019s digital assistant.</p>",
            "<p>And when you expand the view to larger company-wide issues, Samsung\u2019s slowness to update its phones to the latest version of Android is downright embarrassing. Samsung is the biggest phone maker in the world, and recently took <a href=\"https://adage.com/article/news/samsung-overtakes-p-g-world-s-largest-advertiser/315743/?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://adage.com/article/news/samsung-overtakes-p-g-world-s-largest-advertiser/315743/?', {metric25:1})\">P&amp;G\u2019s position is the world\u2019s biggest advertiser</a>, and yet <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/android-p-is-now-officially-android-9-pie-1828133506\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/android-p-is-now-officially-android-9-pie-1828133506', {metric25:1})\">four months after its release</a>, not a single Samsung flagship phone has gotten an upgrade to Android 9 Pie. The only Samsung phone with Android 9 is the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/this-is-probably-how-samsungs-galaxy-s10-will-avoid-the-1830982111\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/this-is-probably-how-samsungs-galaxy-s10-will-avoid-the-1830982111', {metric25:1})\">mid-range A8s</a>, which isn\u2019t available outside of Asia and was just announced last week. When people talk about Android having a fragmentation problem, Samsung is one of the biggest reasons why.</p>",
            "<p>Software, in general, is still a weak point for Samsung. And even though the current Samsung Experience Android skin isn\u2019t nearly as bad as the TouchWiz used to be, given the success of the Pixel 3, software is a shortcoming Samsung can no longer afford. On top of that though, the Galaxy App Store is a mess, Samsung was late to the trend of using AI to enhance your photos, and its <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-s-new-theme-policy-sounds-like-some-bullshit-1830474527\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-s-new-theme-policy-sounds-like-some-bullshit-1830474527', {metric25:1})\">new policy regarding the use of free themes</a> in the forthcoming Android 9 update sucks. That\u2019s a damn shame because a lot of the user-friendly design choices made in OneUI sound good, but they still make up for the fact that it\u2019s way overdue.</p>",
            "<p>Even more concerning is that in 2018, it felt like Samsung got away from what it does best: class-leading, industry-defining hardware. On a pure specs comparison, aside from having a lower-res screen, the OnePlus 6T blows away the GS9 for $100 less. And while the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-note-9-is-the-best-big-phone-1828348138\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-note-9-is-the-best-big-phone-1828348138', {metric25:1})\">Note 9</a> and its built-in stylus remains the best big phone this side of the Pacific, the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-20-pro-is-a-technical-marvel-1830346004\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-20-pro-is-a-technical-marvel-1830346004', {metric25:1})\">Huawei Mate 20 Pro</a> offers full 3D scanning face recognition, reverse wireless charging, an in-screen fingerprint sensor, and three rear cameras\u2014all things that the $1,000 Note 9 doesn\u2019t have.</p>",
            "<p>Weirdly, one place where Samsung decided not to play it safe was with its ads. Because instead of doing the right thing and putting photos taken by its devices for use in promos, Samsung was caught, <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/08/16/samsung-brazil-tried-passing-two-stock-photos-off-galaxy-a8-camera-samples/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/08/16/samsung-brazil-tried-passing-two-stock-photos-off-galaxy-a8-camera-samples/', {metric25:1})\">not once</a>, <a href=\"https://www.diyphotography.net/samsung-used-my-dslr-photo-to-fake-their-phones-portrait-mode/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.diyphotography.net/samsung-used-my-dslr-photo-to-fake-their-phones-portrait-mode/', {metric25:1})\">but twice</a> trying pass off pictures shot on a DSLR as smartphone photos. I don\u2019t really care if the ads only showed up in Brazil, Malaysia, or anywhere else, the corner cutting and dishonesty don\u2019t reflect well well on the company\u2019s decision making.</p>",
            "<p>If Samsung wants to hold onto its top spot, Samsung needs to go all out. Give your flagship phone\u2014both big and small\u2014dual cameras, more RAM, and the kind of world-first features that make people remember how much innovation Samsung has inspired over the years.</p>",

It features detailed renders that once again show a hexagonal, rear-camera layout with five lenses, a flash, and a yet-unknown sixth sensor that could allow the phone to shoot pics using all five cams at once.

However, unlike the Nokia 7.1, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any sort of notch, or even a real attempt to implement a full, bezel-less design like a lot of other modern handsets, which is actually kind of refreshing. </p>",
            "<p>Instead, the Nokia 9 looks to have small, but balanced borders on top and bottom, dual selfie cams, and an indicator light of some sort. Unfortunately, even though there seems to be a fair amount of room on its chin, the Nokia 9 apparently isn\u2019t using that space to tack on a second front-facing speaker. </p>",
            "<p>On top of that, the Nokia 9 may also join other Nokia phones as part of Google\u2019s Android One program, which means the phone would sport stock Android out of the box and would have software updates managed directly by Google\u2014good news for anyone looking to get away from the lethargic update cycle employed by Samsung, LG, and others. </p>",

            "<p>Additional alleged specs for the Nokia 9 PureView include a 5.99-inch 2K HDR10 display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset, 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and Zeiss optics, which will apparently work together with all those sensors to let the Nokia 9 gather \u201c10x more light\u201d compared to a regular smartphone camera sensor. And in a somewhat small but welcome upgrade, it seems the Nokia 9 will even feature an in-display fingerprint sensor instead of the company\u2019s traditional rear-mounted reader. </p>",

            "<p>Last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-note-8-review-bigger-badder-but-i-sti-1799759566\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-note-8-review-bigger-badder-but-i-sti-1799759566', {metric25:1})\">Galaxy Note 8</a> was a totally solid phone, but it  wasn\u2019t very exciting. With a screen that was the same size as what you get on a Galaxy S8+ or <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944', {metric25:1})\">S9+</a>, and a battery that was actually smaller, it felt like Samsung played it safe. </p>",
            "<p>But on the new Galaxy Note 9, it seems Samsung is back to its old, component-cramming ways, and despite looking basically the same as last year\u2019s handset, the Note 9 is packing a lot more muscle inside, which is exactly what I\u2019m looking for in Samsung\u2019s high-end plus-sized phone. </p>",
            "<p>Starting with its screen, the Note 9's QHD AMOLED display remains the best in the business and has been up-sized slightly from 6.3 to 6.4-inches. Meanwhile, on the inside, its battery has gotten a significant bump up to 4,000 mAh, which is more than 20-percent larger than the Note 8's 3,300 mAh power pack. </p>",
            "<p>But the spec juicing doesn\u2019t stop there, because Samsung has also doubled the Note 9's base storage from 64GB to 128GB, while retaining a healthy 6GB of RAM, and the phone\u2019s handy microSD card slot. And in move that\u2019s typically reserved exclusively its Asia-only Galaxy phone variants, Samsung is making a super premium version of the Note 9 for the U.S. with 8GB of RAM and a massive 512GB of storage. From there, you\u2019re just a 512GB microSD card away from having a 1TB phone. </p>",
            "<p>And to keep all the performance from the Note 9's Snapdragon 845 processor running at peak speeds even during prolonged usage, Samsung claims to have bulked up the Note 9's cooling with a new carbon fiber interface to help improve thermal conductivity, and a 335 square-millimeter heat spreader that\u2019s more than three times bigger than the ones in a Galaxy S9+ or Galaxy Note 8.</p>",
            "<p>Even the Note 9's S-Pen has been enhanaced with a built-in supercapcitor that lets the stylus soak up 30 minutes of standby time in just 30 seconds. But that\u2019s not all, because the S-Pen now has built in Bluetooth LE too, so you can use the stylus as a tiny little remote. </p>",
            "<p>Initially, the S-Pen remote feature will be restricted to first-party Samsung apps like the music player or camera app, so you can open the camera by long-pressing the S-Pen\u2019s button, press twice to switch between front and rear cameras, or just tap it once to snap a pic. Yet Samsung plans to build out the S-Pen\u2019s compatibility, and is also providing an SDK for the S-Pen\u2019s remote functions, so later on, developers can add similar features to third-party apps. </p>",
            "<p>Sadly, the Note 9's camera is physically the same as what you get on the Galaxy S9+, with an 8 megapixel camera up front, dual 12-MP cameras in back, variable apertures that can switch between f/1.5 and f/2.4, and a 2x zoom lens on the secondary cam. </p>",
            "<p>However, Samsung did add a little AI smarts to the Note 9's camera app, so  now it can detect  20 different objects and use that info to automatically tweak the phone\u2019s camera settings for the best results. Yet since we\u2019ve seen companies like <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-triple-camera-p20-pro-is-too-cool-for-america-1825647834\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-triple-camera-p20-pro-is-too-cool-for-america-1825647834', {metric25:1})\">Huawei</a>, <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/lgs-g7-thinq-is-too-clever-for-its-own-good-1825818482\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/lgs-g7-thinq-is-too-clever-for-its-own-good-1825818482', {metric25:1})\">LG</a>, and others do the same on phones as far <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-10-pro-is-a-valiant-attempt-to-slay-the-ip-1820480251#_ga=2.150427327.805430461.1533561263-422248777.1525353160\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-10-pro-is-a-valiant-attempt-to-slay-the-ip-1820480251#_ga=2.150427327.805430461.1533561263-422248777.1525353160', {metric25:1})\">back as late 2017</a>, Samsung\u2019s scene optimizer feature doesn\u2019t really feel very innovative. </p>",
            "<p>What does feel innovative is the Note 9's flaw detection feature that can detect when a picture is blurry, backlit or messed up because someone blinked or smudged the lens. It causes the camera to throw up a warning saying you might want to retake the shot. </p>",
            "<p>And for those who want to put all those specs to use in a different sort of way, the Note 9 also includes <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/how-two-big-things-stopped-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s4-fr-1828188260\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/how-two-big-things-stopped-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s4-fr-1828188260', {metric25:1})\">an improved  Dex mode</a> that lets you hook the phone up to an external display and use it like a mini desktop. The one caveat is that you will need one of Samsung\u2019s $50 adapters to make that happen, because a regular USB-C to HDMI dongle won\u2019t trigger the phone into activating Dex mode. </p>",
            "<p>I still wish Samsung had done something more with the Note 9's design, because even though I do like that new deep blue and yellow color scheme, flashy colors only go so far. </p>",
            "<p>Oh, and about all those <em>Fortnite</em> on Android rumors? Well it seems Samsung is giving the Note 9 the first crack at Epic\u2019s <em>Fortnite</em> beta by pre-installing the game out of the box. However, the Note 9 won\u2019t be the only phone capable of dropping in, because starting today, the Galaxy Note 8, the Galaxy Tab S4, and every other Galaxy S phone going back to the Galaxy S7 will also be able to download <em>Fortnite</em> from Samsung\u2019s Game Launcher app. Epic has elected not to put its game on the Google Play Store, so its appearance on Samsung\u2019s Game Launcher will make it one of the easiest methods for sideloading the game onto an Android phone.</p>",
            "<p>But in the end, I still have one big question: Are all these little improvements enough? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m digging all the big numbers and heavy specs, but many of them are things I was hoping to see on the Galaxy Note 8, and just getting them now may be a little too late. This said, I won\u2019t know for sure until I spend more time with the device, so check back soon for a full review of the Galaxy Note 9. </p>",
            "<p>The Note 9 will be available for pre-order starting August 10th, with in-store availability starting August 24th. Unfortunately, since Samsung is once again letting carrier set their own prices, we\u2019re still waiting to see how much the Note 9 will actually cost across all the various networks. </p>",
            "<p><strong>UPDATE 12pm EST:</strong> We now know the price of the Note 9, and yikes. At T-Mobile the 128GB model will start at $1,000, or $30 a month over 24 months, with $280 paid at the time of purchase. The 512GB model will retail for $1,250 or $30 a month over 24 months with $530 paid at the time of purchase.<br></p>",
            "<p>At Verizon you can pay $41.66 over 24 months for the 128GB model, and $52.08 over 24 months for the 512GB model. Sprint has a limited time offer for the 128GB Note 9 where it will be 50-percent off, or just $20.83 a month over 24 months. At AT&amp;T the 128GB model will be $33.34 for 30 months, or $1,000 total.</p>"

            "<p>Since <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-note-lightning-review-wait-who-ordered-5886054\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-note-lightning-review-wait-who-ordered-5886054', {metric25:1})\">the beginning</a>, the big honking screens on Galaxy Note phones have been their most memorable characteristic. But as the rest of the smartphone world caught onto the jumbo display trend and screen sizes from various makers started to converge around six-inch displays, the throne on which Samsung\u2019s Note phones lorded over lesser devices just didn\u2019t have the same kind of sway. So now, the question is: What\u2019s the purpose of a big ass flagship handset in 2018, especially one that starts at pearl-clutching price of $1,000?<br></p>",
            "<p>The answer is to give you everything. It\u2019s as if on the Note 9, Samsung took the ridiculous excess of a <a href=\"https://jalopnik.com/i-cant-imagine-why-nobody-wanted-this-ferrari-360-limo-1822958833\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://jalopnik.com/i-cant-imagine-why-nobody-wanted-this-ferrari-360-limo-1822958833', {metric25:1})\">stretch Ferrari limo</a>, added back in the performance that prancing horse logo is supposed to deliver, and then went over everything with the kind of attention normally reserved for overly-tweezed Michelin star meals. So instead of getting what would otherwise be an S9+ with an S-Pen jammed up its butt, the Note 9 represents a top-to-bottom improvement on how much you can cram in a phone and what it can do.</p>",
            "<p>The Note 9 now sports a 6.4-inch display (0.2-inches larger than the S9+) that manages to look even more <a href=\"http://www.displaymate.com/Galaxy_Note9_ShootOut_44N9.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://www.displaymate.com/Galaxy_Note9_ShootOut_44N9.htm', {metric25:1})\">vibrant and colorful than any other phone screen on the market</a>, which is quite impressive since Samsung is already the manufacturer responsible for the displays in its Galaxy phones and the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/i-hate-how-much-i-love-the-iphone-x-1820086867\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/i-hate-how-much-i-love-the-iphone-x-1820086867', {metric25:1})\">iPhone X</a>. Meanwhile on the inside, Samsung provides 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage standard, with the option of upgrading to an even higher-specced model with 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for around $1,250 (depending on where you buy it). That means better multitasking due to less closing of background apps, and the freedom to download and install whatever you want without fear of running out of room. Add in a microSD card slot that can handle another 512GB or more, and you\u2019re looking at a phone that can hold north a 1TB. Yes, this is way more than anyone actually needs, but when you\u2019re paying this much, there\u2019s no reason to skimp.</p>",
            "<p>Samsung also paid attention to little things like Note 9's thermal management, and installed carbon fiber heat spreaders that are three times larger than the ones in <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944', {metric25:1})\">the Galaxy S9</a> and <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-note-8-review-bigger-badder-but-i-sti-1799759566\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-note-8-review-bigger-badder-but-i-sti-1799759566', {metric25:1})\">Galaxy Note 8</a>. That means in addition to letting the Note 9's Snapdragon 845 processor run more freely, resulting in slightly higher scores in Geekbench 4 (9,012 for the Note 9 vs 8,414 for S9+), the Note 9 can also sustain that performance for longer periods of time.</p>",
            "<p>So after running my initial benchmarks, I tested this by taking the Note 9 and a Galaxy S9+ out for spin involving a few rounds of <em>Fortnite</em>, repeated runs of 3DMark\u2019s Slingshot Extreme graphics test, and downloading a few torrents, all back to back. Basically, anything I could to stress out the phone and turn up the heat. Then, I ran Geekbench one more time to see how much each phone\u2019s performance had been impacted. The Note 9 fell a bit down to 8,053 (a drop of around 10 percent), while the Galaxy S9+ suffered significantly more, with its score falling over 25 percent to 6,171. That said, it seems graphics performance doesn\u2019t benefit quite as much from the Note 9's improved thermal management, because when I ran 3DMark Slingshot Extreme Unlimited one more time, both phones posted nearly equivalent marks of 4,974 for the Note 9, and 4,923 for the S9+, down from 5,021 and 5,033 respectively.</p>",
            "<p>I do wish Samsung had done something, anything to change up the Note 9's design. Aside from a selection of new colors including ocean blue and lavender purple (which is essentially the same as the lilac paint job seen on the Galaxy S9), the main difference between the Note 9 and last year\u2019s model is an almost imperceptible increase in heft.</p>",
            "<p>Physically, the Note 9's 12-MP dual rear cameras are also more or less unchanged, though Samsung says it has rebuilt the phone\u2019s image processing from the ground up, while also adding two new features to the phone\u2019s camera app. The first is Samsung\u2019s scene optimizer, which like we\u2019ve seen on previous <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-triple-camera-p20-pro-is-too-cool-for-america-1825647834\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-triple-camera-p20-pro-is-too-cool-for-america-1825647834', {metric25:1})\">Huawei</a> and <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/lgs-g7-thinq-is-too-clever-for-its-own-good-1825818482\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/lgs-g7-thinq-is-too-clever-for-its-own-good-1825818482', {metric25:1})\">LG phones</a>, uses image recognition to detect objects in your shot, before adjusting the camera settings accordingly. At this point, the idea of using machine learning to help achieve optimal results isn\u2019t exactly new, but the practice  does help improve the quality of some of the most frequently snapped types of pics. </p>",
            "<p>However, to all those people who continue to swear up and down about how the Pixel 2 is clearly the best smartphone camera, just stop it, it\u2019s not. Between the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/iphone-x-six-months-later-1825722111\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/iphone-x-six-months-later-1825722111', {metric25:1})\">iPhone X</a>, <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/pixel-2-review-google-sticks-to-what-it-does-best-1819557944\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/pixel-2-review-google-sticks-to-what-it-does-best-1819557944', {metric25:1})\">the Pixel 2</a>, the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-triple-camera-p20-pro-is-too-cool-for-america-1825647834\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-triple-camera-p20-pro-is-too-cool-for-america-1825647834', {metric25:1})\">Huawei P20 Pro</a> and the Galaxy Note 9, there isn\u2019t a single smartphone that beats out its competition 100 percent of the time, or depending on the match up, even 75 percent of the time. I will say, that with Google\u2019s advanced HDR+ processing, the Pixel 2 tends to has a slight advantage over Note 9 in bright, daytime situations. However, in low light, I ran into multiple situations where the Note 9 out shot a Pixel 2 XL.</p>",
            "<p>Take for example a shot of a nearby church in which the Note 9's pic is superior across the board with richer colors, less noise, sharper details, and better exposure. And with those spotlights pointing up on the sides, this scene wasn\u2019t really all that dark. In another photo of a diner shut down for the night, the Note 9 once again captured a significantly better looking image, with much less grain and clearer objects, especially as you look into the background. In both situations, the Note 9's scene optimizer correctly identified that it was a nighttime pic, which when combined with the phone\u2019s wider max aperture of f/1.5 resulted in wins for Samsung.</p>",
            "<p>But what impressed me the most was when I tried to take a shot in the rain. This time, both phones captured fantastic looking shots that if I had seen them more than a year ago, I would have been floored to learn they came from phone cameras. Picking between the two is basically a toss up. The Pixel 2 XL did a better job of preserving the texture on the concrete parking garage in the back, while the Note 9 did more to eliminate the heavy yellow tint in the center of the frame, and something the Pixel 2 can\u2019t match is the 2x optical zoom on the Note 9's second rear camera. </p>",
            "<p>However, the Note 9 wasn\u2019t always impeccable. Note the second to last image in the slide show above. You can see  how the Note 9 absolutely missed on both white balance and at recognizing a piece of cake.</p>",
            "<p>Flaw detection, noting when an image is bad and telling you to try the shot again, is a nice bonus, but I think Samsung could have taken the feature even further. Right now, the Note 9 can tell if a picture is blurry, the lens is smudged, the photo is backlit, or if someone blinked while taking the picture, and then alert you that you might want to try again to avoid ending up with an unsatisfactory pic. But what I\u2019d really like to see is for the phone to take that info, and then adjust its camera settings like it does with scene optimizer so the Note 9 could increase  shutter speed to cancel out motion blur, or turn on the flash to  prevent backlighting from making your subject look underexposed. Flaw detection is an interesting trick, but after using it, I\u2019m already seeing how it could be so much better. </p>",
            "<p>When it comes to the Note 9's other signature feature\u2014the S-Pen\u2014Samsung thankfully hasn\u2019t forgotten to include its usual assortment of Air Command abilities. It has all sorts of functions including built-in translation, one of the simplest methods of making gifs on a phone, and a myriad of ways to make sketching on pretty much anything a blast. But Samsung didn\u2019t stop there, because now the S-Pen comes with Bluetooth low-energy so it can be used like a tiny remote. </p>",
            "<p>In the Note 9's settings, the S-Pen\u2019s button can be configured to open a number of apps, while also performing additional contextual functions like long-pressing to switch between front and rear cameras when taking pictures, or a quick press to simply snap a pic without needing to actually touch the phone. And while it might sound like a small thing, I really like the S-Pen\u2019s ability to pause music or YouTube videos with a single press, just because now, switching between working and relaxing, when necessary, is that much faster. And for high-powered business types, the ability to control Powerpoint slides using the S-Pen is another helpful skills. No more relying on other people\u2019s unfamiliar equipment or a second person to make sure your presentation goes smoothly\u2014you\u2019ve already got what you need.</p>",
            "<p>This brings me to the Note 9's Dex mode\u2014the mode that lets you connect the phone to a monitor and use like a PC. It has been refined and is now even easier to setup. Unlike previous attempts at turning a phone into desktop on the S8 and S9, the Note 9 only needs a simple USB-C to HDMI adapter to take advantage of a nearby external monitor. Officially, Samsung says its $50 dongle and older Dex pads are the only fully supported ways to do this, but technically any adapter should work. From there, you just need to connect a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, and then all of a sudden, you have a full desktop environment to play around with. </p>",
            "<p>If you ask me though, Dex mode is actually the best way to clown on people in <em>Fortnite</em>, particularly other mobile players who are forced to fight back using sad, unresponsive touchscreen controls (though to do this, you will need an adapter with more ports that lets you hook up wired peripherals). And while Huawei\u2019s P20 Pro offers similar desktop functionality via a USB-C to HDMI adapter, Dex mode\u2019s better UI is truly the closest any company has ever come to achieving the dream of having a phone that can transform into a real computer at a moment\u2019s notice. And even though I know it would probably result in a massive waste of money, I kind of wish Samsung would make a laptop dock for the Note 9 like HP did for the <a rel=\"nofollow\" data-amazonasin=\"B01M14FYYU\" data-amazonsubtag=\"[t|link[p|1828348138[a|B01M14FYYU[au|5876237249237183654[b|gizmodo[lt|text\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Commerce', 'gizmodo - You Can Really Feel the Samsung Note 9&amp;#39;s $1000 Price Tag&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;', 'B01M14FYYU');window.ga('unique.send', 'event', 'Commerce', 'gizmodo - You Can Really Feel the Samsung Note 9&amp;#39;s $1000 Price Tag&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;', 'B01M14FYYU');\" data-amazontag=\"gizmodoamzn-20\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HP-V8H07UT-ABA-Premium-Package/dp/B01M14FYYU?tag=gizmodoamzn-20&amp;ascsubtag=86cef82c36e5ec85f59a96100b84b7d056f8afba\">Elite x3</a> or Motorola for the weird and wonderful <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/motorola-atrix-review-great-phone-weak-netbook-5765852\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/motorola-atrix-review-great-phone-weak-netbook-5765852', {metric25:1})\">Atrix</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Ok, so this is all fun and great, but what about the Note 9's battery life? I admit, I may have sandbagged a bit, but I wanted to save the best part for last, because the Note 9's battery life is incredible. With a time of 14 hours and 11 minutes on our rundown test, the Note 9 is the second longest-lasting phone we\u2019ve ever tested, behind only the Asus Zenfone 4 Max\u2014 which was a handset designed with only one goal in mind: longevity. Last year, Samsung went with a battery on the Note 8 that was actually 200 mAh smaller than what you got on <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-the-prettiest-phone-wins-1794526975\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-the-prettiest-phone-wins-1794526975', {metric25:1})\">an S8+</a>. But for 2018, Samsung increased the size of the Note 9's battery by almost 15 percent when compared to the S9+, and it\u2019s made quite a difference.</p>",
            "<p>Unfortunately, this also reminds me of the Note 9's biggest flaw: the lack of <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/android-p-is-now-officially-android-9-pie-1828133506\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/android-p-is-now-officially-android-9-pie-1828133506', {metric25:1})\">Android 9 Pie</a>. With the timing of Google\u2019s new OS getting released a few days ahead of the Note 9's debut, I was hoping it meant Samsung\u2019s had worked with Google to get the newest version of Android running on the Note. But instead we get Android 8.1. What a bummer, because aside from handy <a href=\"https://fieldguide.gizmodo.com/12-cool-things-you-can-do-in-android-9-pie-that-you-cou-1828160005\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://fieldguide.gizmodo.com/12-cool-things-you-can-do-in-android-9-pie-that-you-cou-1828160005', {metric25:1})\">new additions in Pie like App Actions</a>, better volume controls, and more, the idea of Android 9's Adaptive Battery letting the Note 9 last even longer per charge is tantalizing proposition. And based on the schedule for when the Note 8 got Android 8 Oreo, it\u2019ll be at least a few months before the Note 9 gets Android 9.</p>",
            "<p>The one thing I still need more time with is Bixby, because while Samsung showed how its voice assistant has been improved with better natural language recognition and the ability to buy tickets or book a restaurant without needing a specific app, less than a week isn\u2019t enough to see how much smarter it\u2019s gotten. </p>",
            "<p>So what does $1,000 really get you? Here goes: The Note 9 boasts the biggest, most captivating screen, blazing performance, top-tier photography, and some of the best battery life you can get in a phone. Then you pile on things like the S-Pen, Dex mode, massive optional storage, more RAM than an average laptop, and important supporting components like a headphone jack, wireless charging, IP68 water resistance, and more, and what you get is big phone that\u2019s at the top of its class. Nothing else out right now has as many tools, tricks or feature as what Samsung smashed into the Note 9. And while its price tag means this isn\u2019t a device for everyone, for the people who want to push the limits of what a phone can really do, the Note 9 is here to give them that opportunity.</p>",

And that\u2019s in part because next year will be the 10th anniversary of the Galaxy S line.</p>",
            "<p>According to a new report from the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/samsungs-top-secret-galaxy-s-phone-is-a-5g-monster-with-six-cameras-1542713404\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/samsungs-top-secret-galaxy-s-phone-is-a-5g-monster-with-six-cameras-1542713404', {metric25:1})\"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>, Samsung is going to blow out the Galaxy S10 lineup with three new models featuring screens ranging from 5.8 to 6.4 inches, along with a fourth, 5G-ready model with a massive 6.7-inch display and a total of six cameras littered across its body.<br></p>",
            "<p>While the <em>WSJ</em> mentions that two of those cameras are reserved for the front of the special edition S10\u2014which has reportedly been codenamed Beyond X\u2014the report doesn\u2019t say what each of the other four lenses are for. If I had my say, I\u2019d like to see a high-res main camera, a wide-angle lens for capturing landscapes, and lens with a 3x optical zoom for shooting faraway subjects, and one lens dedicated for shooting in low-light scenarios. </p>",
            "<p>If the report is accurate, Samsung\u2019s six-camera S10 would one-up the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/lgs-5-camera-phone-offers-a-snapshot-of-the-incredible-1829488124\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/lgs-5-camera-phone-offers-a-snapshot-of-the-incredible-1829488124', {metric25:1})\">five-camera V40</a> released by fellow South Korean electronics giant LG this fall. However, even with all those lenses, it\u2019s quite possible Nokia might steal the spotlight from Samsung with a still-<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/this-alleged-nokia-leak-has-me-eager-for-five-lens-smar-1828866673#_ga=2.261276237.1905119484.1542663688-1182680357.1539885723\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/this-alleged-nokia-leak-has-me-eager-for-five-lens-smar-1828866673#_ga=2.261276237.1905119484.1542663688-1182680357.1539885723', {metric25:1})\">unreleased handset featuring five rear cameras</a> that appeared in leaked photos back in September. </p>",
            "<p>Now, based on the success of the Pixel 3 and its single rear camera, some people might argue that all of those additional cameras smartphone makers are cramming onto devices aren\u2019t all that unnecessary. But that\u2019s not quite right.</p>",
            "<p>Instead, increasing the number of cameras is more like a different path to the same end goal, because you have to remember that at its core, Google has always been a software-driven company, while Samsung\u2019s strength lies in hardware. And by combining photographic info from multiple lenses, a four-cam setup could be Samsung\u2019s best response to the computational photography used in many of the Pixel 3's advanced camera features like <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/googles-incredible-night-sight-mode-was-worth-the-wait-1830432540\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/googles-incredible-night-sight-mode-was-worth-the-wait-1830432540', {metric25:1})\">Night Sight</a> and Super Res Zoom. </p>",
            "<p>But even with as many as four Galaxy S10 devices in the works, the most exciting thing about smartphones in 2019 might still be Samsung\u2019s upcoming bendable phone. Up till now, Samsung\u2019s folding phone has simply been dubbed the Galaxy F. However, the <em>WSJ</em> claims Samsung has narrowed the list of potential names, with Samsung Flex or Galaxy Flex currently billed as the most likely final designations.</p>",
            "<p>Either way, between this rumored bunch of Galaxy S10s, the Galaxy Flex, a rumored mid-range Pixel from Google, Nokia\u2019s 5-rear camera phone, and the rollout of mobile 5G, 2019 is already shaping up to be an incredibly interesting year for phones.

            "<p>Samsung is one of the clear leaders in mobile display tech, and its  screens are found in a wide range of flagship devices including its own Galaxy phones and those of its biggest competitors like Apple. However, one of the biggest complaints about the Galaxy S9 is that looks virtually identical to last year\u2019s device, a sentiment that arose largely due to the fact that Samsung didn\u2019t do much to change up the S9's screen. </p>",
            "<p>However, based on a number of leaks and rumors, that may not be an issue for Samsung\u2019s next big phone, which could boast one of the most advanced mobile displays yet. </p>",

            "<p>That last one is a biggie, because if it works, it would allow Samsung to install things like a selfie camera or iris scanners beneath the actual display, which would eradicate the need for a bezel. And when a phone used those sensors to take a picture or unlock the device, it would only need to turn off the pixels above each sensor for the component to function normally. </p>",
            "<p>If Samsung is able to perfect all these features and cram them into a single display, that would pave the way for an all-screen phone that wouldn\u2019t require the pop up camera housings that we\u2019ve seen on devices like the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/this-gorgeous-all-screen-phone-shows-how-the-notch-dies-1829737051\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/this-gorgeous-all-screen-phone-shows-how-the-notch-dies-1829737051', {metric25:1})\">Oppo Find X</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vivo.com/in/products/nex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.vivo.com/in/products/nex', {metric25:1})\">Vivo Nex</a>. </p>",

            "<p>Android 9 Pie was released more than three months ago, but Samsung phones, including the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944', {metric25:1})\">Galaxy S9</a> and <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-note-9-is-the-best-big-phone-1828348138\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-note-9-is-the-best-big-phone-1828348138', {metric25:1})\">Galaxy Note 9</a>, still aren\u2019t running the latest software. As Samsung works on updating its devices to Android 9 in the coming months, today we learned there\u2019s one really annoying change in policy that will be waiting for users when it\u2019s ready.</p>",
            "<p>According to a notice sent out by Samsung, free themes in its store will only work for 14 days once users upgrade to Android 9, after which the phone will revert back to Samsung\u2019s default One UI skin.</p>",
            "<p>For people who don\u2019t want to revert, Samsung says it will provide a pop-up notification one day before the end of the 14-day usage period, with a second notification 10 minutes before the theme automatically changes back to the default.</p>",
            "<p>Samsung\u2019s One UI is a new take on the company\u2019s long-running Android skin. The interface is the successor to Touch Wiz and its more recent evolution, the Samsung Experience UI, which is currently featured in new Galaxy devices. The One UI was unveiled last week at the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-s-flexible-display-is-our-best-look-yet-at-its-1830290960\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-s-flexible-display-is-our-best-look-yet-at-its-1830290960', {metric25:1})\">Samsung Developer Conference</a> and features a more intuitive interface design to make frequently used features easier to reach while also cutting down on some of the bloat people disliked about Samsung\u2019s previous skins. </p>",
            "<p>In its notice, Samsung doesn\u2019t offer an explanation for this change in policy, but if you\u2019ll allow me to speculate a bit, I think there are two main arguments behind the move. The first is that, with the introduction of One UI, Samsung would probably really like it if everyone just used the company\u2019s shiny new interface. The other reason is that, with the notice coming so shortly after its dev conference, Samsung may be trying to appease theme makers by encouraging users to buy paid themes rather than relying on free alternatives. </p>",
            "<p>We\u2019ve reached out to Samsung for an official comment on the matter and we will update the story if we hear back.</p>",
            "<p>But here\u2019s the thing that\u2019s really annoying: No matter how Samsung tries to explain it, a 14-day trial for a theme\u2014which is effectively what its notice describes\u2014isn\u2019t the same as free. Even if users don\u2019t fork over any money for a theme, if it disappears after two weeks, they can\u2019t really say they own it. That\u2019s a loan at best.</p>",
            "<p>Hopefully, Samsung will change it policy before its Android 9 update rolls out officially, because as it stands now, there\u2019s going to be a bunch of pissed off Galaxy phone owners in the coming months.</p>"

And unlike phones from Samsung or Huawei, the Pixel 3 achieved this not by hitting users over the head with tons of cameras or far-out hardware; it did it in the most Google way possible: With nifty software, intuitive design, and AI-powered smarts.<br></p>",
            "<p>But at the same time, the Pixel 3 is also one of the most frustrating phones of the year, because, for all of its upgrades and additions, it\u2019s not difficult to see a number of small tweaks that would have made it so much better. And if you step back and look past the Pixel 3 itself, there are a lot of issues that show Google still has a long way to go before it can truly call itself a world-class phone maker.</p>",
            "<p>If you just look at the Pixel 3's specs, its price doesn\u2019t make any sense. Sure, you get a Snapdragon 845 processor, which is the same chip found in every other flagship Android phone. But both the standard $700 Pixel and the $750 Pixel 3 XL\u2014which have already been discounted $100 to $250 in the three months since its launch\u2014only get 4GB of RAM.</p>",
            "<p>Compared to Samsung, while the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944', {metric25:1})\">Galaxy S9</a> also has 4GB of memory, the S9+ gets 6GBs. But it\u2019s OnePlus that really makes the Pixel 3's price look ridiculous by offering a config of <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/oneplus-6t-review-the-no-bullshit-best-deal-in-smartph-1830066240\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/oneplus-6t-review-the-no-bullshit-best-deal-in-smartph-1830066240', {metric25:1})\">the OP6T</a> with 8GB of RAM and 128GB GBs of storage (both double what you get on a Pixel 3) for just $580. That\u2019s an extra 64GB of room for stashing pictures, apps, videos, and anything else you save on your phone, while that extra RAM lets you keep multiple apps (games especially) suspended in the background, so you aren\u2019t constantly forced to reload them into memory.</p>",
            "<p>What happened to the ethos of old Nexus phones that paired stock Android to well-built devices with reasonable price tags? With the cost of flagship phones hitting new highs every year, a really good $500 phone has never been more important, and yet, it\u2019s a sector that so many companies are just ceding to OnePlus and other Chinese phone makers.</p>",
            "<p>Then there\u2019s the Pixel 3's\u00a05.5-inch 2160 x 1080 OLED screen. Compared to the 5.8-inch 2960 x 1440 display on the Galaxy S9, Samsung\u2019s screen not only offers a higher pixel density, but it\u2019s brighter and more vibrant as well. On top of that, like the iPhone, the Pixel 3 doesn\u2019t have expandable storage or a headphone jack. So what are you paying for? Some black paint inside the USB-C port, wireless charging (a feature that should have been on last year\u2019s Pixel 2), and a fancy soft-touch micro-etched glass back? The math just doesn\u2019t add up.</p>",
            "<p>But what\u2019s annoying is that as amazing as Google\u2019s computational photography and HDR+ mode are, the Pixel 3 could be an even better picture taker if Google truly embraced the dual camera trend. It\u2019s maddening because Google\u2019s use of dual front-facing cams on the Pixel 3 for capturing super wide angle selfies demonstrates that the company is aware of the potential benefits of multiple cameras.

For a flagship, it feels like Google did the bare minimum needed to assemble the Pixel 3, and then relied on its software prowess to carry the phone the rest of the way. It\u2019s not just the Pixel 3, just look across Google\u2019s entire range of products, and in most cases, the company goes out of its way to avoid talking about specs or components.</p>",
            "<p>Instead, Google focuses on things like designs with bright, friendly colors and textured fabrics that fit in with modern living. It feels like Google hopes its devices will appear simple and innocuous like a light switch on a wall, which makes sense from an ease-of-use standpoint and for devices like the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/its-hard-not-to-love-the-google-home-mini-1819341054\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/its-hard-not-to-love-the-google-home-mini-1819341054', {metric25:1})\">Home Mini.</a> But if Google is really going to challenge Apple and Samsung, it needs to care more about hardware too.</p>",

            "<p>Nothing ruins a new smartphone more than critical features like messaging or the camera not working, and as a reviewer, it\u2019s frustrating to see people suffer from issues you didn\u2019t experience while testing, especially when the only advice you can give is to say that \u201cGoogle is working on patching the issue soon.\u201d</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s a similar issue for features like <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2018/11/28/comment-google-pixel-launch-buy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://9to5google.com/2018/11/28/comment-google-pixel-launch-buy/', {metric25:1})\">Night Sight</a> and <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/i-broke-google-duplex-but-its-still-impressive-1827131546\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/i-broke-google-duplex-but-its-still-impressive-1827131546', {metric25:1})\">Google Duplex</a>, because as good as they are, if you tease them at your launch event, they probably ought to be available when the phone first goes on sale. Is DLC something we need to worry about on phones now too?</p>",
            "<p>There are also other notable concerns like Google\u2019s ramshackle quality control.

And when I asked for comment on the issue, Google said some variances in manufacturing sometimes results in minor difference. But the thing is, iPhones and Galaxys don\u2019t suffer from these kinds of issues, the Pixel shouldn\u2019t either.</p>",
            "<p>Ben Schoon over at 9to5Google recently made a case that between all of the bugs and issues new Pixel owners tend to experience at launch\u2014and all the price reductions that follow shortly after\u2014<a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2018/11/28/comment-google-pixel-launch-buy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://9to5google.com/2018/11/28/comment-google-pixel-launch-buy/', {metric25:1})\">that no one should buy a Pixel at launch ever again</a>. And while I won\u2019t go that far (Google has one more chance to get it right), early Pixel adopters do seem to be treated more like beta testers more than buyers of any other phone.</p>",
            "<p>And when it comes to the way Google collects data from your phone, there\u2019s unrest brewing. On the one hand, a lot of very handy features like traffic alerts for your daily commute, restaurants suggestions, and f<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/googles-feature-for-predicting-flight-delays-actually-s-1831148930\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/googles-feature-for-predicting-flight-delays-actually-s-1831148930', {metric25:1})\">light delay predictions</a> are things that can only work if Google knows some pretty intimate details about you. But at the same time, concerns about privacy and data security are becoming more prevalent, and issues like <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.apnews.com/828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb', {metric25:1})\">Android tracking</a> you even when you specifically turn the feature off isn\u2019t helping anyone feel better about our new super-connected world.</p>",
            "<p>Lastly, Google\u2019s partnership with Verizon as the \u201cexclusive\u201d retailer of the Pixel is bullshit. Yes, you can buy an unlocked Pixel 3 direct from Google and take it to pretty much any carrier you want, but if Google wants to compete with Apple and Samsung, the Pixel needs to be available in every carrier store, regardless of what name is on the sign outside.</p>",
            "<p>I still believe the Pixel 3 is the best phone for most people. But the gap between the Pixel 3 and other phones isn\u2019t nearly as wide as it could have been. And after three years, while Google was finally able to put all the pieces together properly in creating the Pixel 3, until Google can offer the kind of quality control, stability, and value you get from iPhones and Galaxys, the Pixel may be forced to live in their shadows.</p>",

One that can be so annoying it could make you swear off the OS altogether. It takes forever for the Google\u2019s OS updates to trickle down to products manufactured by companies like Samsung, OnePlus, and Huawei. So while Samsung S9 and OnePlus 5 owners can now rejoice in the fact that they could have Android 9 Pie by the end of the year (depending on where they live), other Android users, including owners of year-old Samsung devices, get to wait until well into next year. And that\u2019s really stupid!<br></p>",
            "<p>Android 9 Pie has had slow to rollout thus far. When Google r<a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/', {metric25:1})\">eleased the latest numbers of Android version adoption back in October</a> Pie was entirely absent despite being out for nearly two months. Which means either Pie was purposely excluded or it has had a miserable adoption rate of 0.1-percent (the minimum required for Google to include a version in the chart). </p>",
            "<p>So it\u2019s not surprising it has taken Samsung this long. As many in America settled down to enjoy a couple of days off work this week, Samsung<a href=\"http://doc.samsungmobile.com/SM-G960F/000286180310/eng.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://doc.samsungmobile.com/SM-G960F/000286180310/eng.html', {metric25:1})\"> began rolling out the update</a> from Android 8 Oreo to Android 9 Pie to a select number of Samsung Galaxy S9 handsets. So far, the update is only rolling out in Germany, Switzerland, Italy, United Arab Emirates, Netherlands, and Turkey. <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s9-android-pie-update-begins-rolling-out\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s9-android-pie-update-begins-rolling-out', {metric25:1})\">Tech Radar notes</a> that the rest of the S9 family should have the update next month, but that\u2019s still five months after Pie first became available in August 2018. Note 9 owners will have to wait until February 2019, while Note 8 and S8 owners will have to wait until March 2019 at the earliest.</p>",
            "<p>That\u2019s right, the older the handset, the longer the wait. Android 9 Pie, known as Android P before its launch, isn\u2019t exactly the biggest update to come to the operating system, but it <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/12-cool-things-you-can-do-in-android-9-pie-that-you-cou-1828160005#_ga=2.132442699.458308337.1545831354-1595880060.1539636540\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/12-cool-things-you-can-do-in-android-9-pie-that-you-cou-1828160005#_ga=2.132442699.458308337.1545831354-1595880060.1539636540', {metric25:1})\">does include cool features</a> like a Digital Wellbeing app to help you manage how much you stare at your phone, as well as more refined control over myriad notifications. These are great features that anyone with a Pixel can already enjoy, and have been able to since Google released the update in August.</p>",
            "<p>The giant gap between Android Pie\u2019s release and anticipated global availability for the Samsung S9, which launched back in March, feels excruciatingly obnoxious at this point. But this has also been the curse of Android from the get-go. The vanilla operating system might have been available in August, but Samsung runs a custom skin over it, and it takes time to update and test that customized version of the operating system. There\u2019s no clear and easy way to speed up that timeline\u2014apart from Samsung going vanilla, or hiring more software engineers.</p>",
            "<p>Samsung isn\u2019t the only manufacturer plagued with this problem. Nvidia has suffered its own update woes this year. Its 4K set-top box, the Shield, was finally updated to Android 8 Oreo back in June, <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2018/05/31/nvidia-shield-tv-android-oreo-update-halted/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://9to5google.com/2018/05/31/nvidia-shield-tv-android-oreo-update-halted/', {metric25:1})\">months late</a> and nearly a year after Google released Oreo. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 5 and OnePlus 5T are both getting Pie by the end of this month (the 5 launched June 2017, the 5T launched November 2017). <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/21/oneplus-android-pie-oxygenos-released/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/21/oneplus-android-pie-oxygenos-released/', {metric25:1})\">Their successor, the OnePlus 6, got Pie</a> a few months ago.</p>",
            "<p>It\u2019s hard to produce these updates, but one can\u2019t deny that these companies also look like absolute clowns when compared to Google or Apple. Google is going with a vanilla version of Android that can be updated very quickly after a new release because nothing really major needs to be tweaked, while Apple\u2019s closed ecosystem allows it to build its operating system to work perfectly with a handful of devices designed in-house. Thus Google and Apple can roll out updates quickly.</p>",
            "<p>Sure, companies like Samsung tweak and modify Android to add their own innovative features, but dang, it\u2019s annoying that it comes at the cost of being six months to a year behind Pixel devices on the core OS.</p>"

            "<p>But don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve got your back because we\u2019ve tested and reviewed all of this year\u2019s most important phones so you don\u2019t have to. So here are our top picks for the best phone you should buy right now.</p>",
            "<p>What Google\u2019s Pixel 3 lacks in sheer specs, it more than makes up for in software thanks to incredible features like Night Sight, a built-in call screener, and all the other Pixel-specific tweaks that make Google\u2019s homegrown phones the smartest and most considerate handsets on the market. And with things like Google\u2019s AI-powered appointment booking service <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/i-broke-google-duplex-but-its-still-impressive-1827131546\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/i-broke-google-duplex-but-its-still-impressive-1827131546', {metric25:1})\">Duplex</a>, the Pixel 3 is only going to get better.</p>",

However, class-leading design isn\u2019t the only thing the S9 has going on. It was one of the first phones on the market sporting Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 845 chipset, and on its rear camera, Samsung created the first smartphone lens with a variable aperture to help capture best photos possible, no matter how much light is available. And while the S9 isn\u2019t the newest phone on this list, because it\u2019s been around for it, you can get a brand new S9 for as little as $520, or $640 for the S9+.</p>",
            "<p>Thanks to an increasing number of $1,000 phones, mid-range handsets have never been more important. And year after year OnePlus keeps pumping out affordable devices that are far and away the best handsets you get for around $500. And with the 6T, OnePlus is actually pulling further ahead thanks to a partnership with T-Mobile that puts OnePlus phones in carrier stores for the first time ever. And unlike previous handsets, the OP6T is the company\u2019s first device with support for Verizon\u2019s network too. You also get specs that match the best flagships out right now, an in-screen fingerprint reader, and a gorgeous OLED display with a notch that isn\u2019t offensively large.</p>",

With a Snapdragon 845 chip, 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, the standard XZ2 has all the specs you want in a flagship phone for just $500. And featuring Sony\u2019s super powerful haptic vibration engine, the XZ2 has the power to add a rumble to pretty much any content you watch or listen to on your phone. Meanwhile, the XZ2 Compact might be the last bastion for people who still like small phones but don\u2019t want to compromise on specs or performance. And unlike it\u2019s bigger sibling, the XZ2 Compact is certified to work on GSM carriers like AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, and Verizon\u2019s CDMA network as well.</p>",
            "<p>Note: We considered putting the Pocophone F1 here as well due to its flagship specs and incredible value, we haven\u2019t had a chance to spend as much time with it as we\u2019d like. Also, due to its very limited support for 4G LTE here in the U.S., it\u2019s difficult to recommend.</p>",
            "<p>For years, Motorola\u2019s G-series phones have been the kings of the budget phone world, and the G6 is a latest and greatest example of Moto\u2019s dominance. Critically, the G6 boasts compatibility with all the major carriers, is available both unlocked and from brick-and-mortar wireless stores, and still retains important features like microSD card expandability and a headphone jack.

Because for the extra money, you get more base storage and RAM, better cameras, a bigger, brighter screen, and a much nicer design. And since the Nokia 7.1 is part of Google\u2019s Android One program, that also means its software and security updates are managed by Google, and you won\u2019t have to put up with any unwanted bloatware either. The major downsides to the Nokia 7.1 is that unlike the G6, it\u2019s only available as an unlocked device from third-party retailers, and it doesn\u2019t support CDMA networks like Verizon or Sprint.</p>",
            "<p>Like hypercars, hyper phones are handsets that are big, fast, and defined by excess. But if you want a phone that can handle everything home and work can throw at you, the Note 9 is it. It\u2019s got a big, gorgeous 6.4-inch display, ridiculous battery life that lasts upwards of upwards of 14 hours on a charge, built-in iris scanners and a secure folder to hide sensitive documents, and of course Samsung\u2019s S-Pen. The phone even comes with 128GB of base storage (and a microSD card slot), which is twice what you get from a similarly priced iPhone XS. And just in case that\u2019s not enough, you can even turn the Note 9 into a mini desktop by hooking up a USB-C to HDMI cable to a nearby monitor.</p>",

That\u2019s because even though it lacks a stylus, it has pretty much every other feature you\u2019d ever need, and maybe even a few tricks you didn\u2019t even know you wanted. We\u2019re talking about full-on 3D face scanning tech, a fingerprint sensor that\u2019s built into the screen, a new 7-nanometer chipset with dual NPUs, and even wireless charging that can be reversed in order to power up other devices.</p>",
            "<p>With three new iPhones for 2018 along with two older models still on sale, choosing the right phone from Apple is actually a bit trickier than normal. However, with a somewhat reasonable (for Apple) price of $750, the same A12 processor, FaceID tech, and 64GB of storage you get from its more expensive siblings, the iPhone XR is our top recommendation for people who want a new Apple handset. As an added bonus, the iPhone XR also boasts battery life that\u2019s about an hour longer than the $1,000 iPhone XS, and it comes it a bunch of fun colors.</p>",
            "<p>For people who want a little more, the<strong>\u00a0</strong><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-xs-is-forever-1829305262\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-xs-is-forever-1829305262', {metric25:1})\">iPhone XS or XS Max</a> are the clear upgrades to the XR, just know that you\u2019ll need to shell out at least an extra $250 to get one. The main benefits when moving up to the iPhone XS and XS Max is a significantly more vibrant and higher resolution OLED screen that\u2019ll make all sorts of content look better, and a second rear camera with a 2x zoom to help bolster your mobile photo toolkit. Also, thanks to new stronger glass backs and an IP68 rating for water-resistance (versus the XR\u2019s IP67 rating), Apple\u2019s high-end iPhones should also be slightly more durable than the iPhone XR.</p>"

            "<p>However, when it comes to the Note 9's long-rumored in-display fingerprint reader, things aren\u2019t quite as clear. Earlier this spring, a patent filing discovered by <a href=\"https://hub.91mobiles.com/samsung-new-patent-under-display-fingerprint-scanner-details/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://hub.91mobiles.com/samsung-new-patent-under-display-fingerprint-scanner-details/', {metric25:1})\">91 Mobiles</a> made it seem like the Note 9 would have a fingerprint reader built into the phone\u2019s display.

            "<p>For me, the one spec I think Samsung would be wrong to skimp on is the Note 9's battery capacity. Last year, the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-note-8-review-bigger-badder-but-i-sti-1799759566\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-note-8-review-bigger-badder-but-i-sti-1799759566', {metric25:1})\">Note 8</a> only had a 3,300 mAh battery, which was actually smaller than the 3,500 power pack that came in the S8+. And even though the Note 8's battery life was pretty decent at 10 hours and 21 minutes, Samsung\u2019s Note phones are supposed to be all about power, productivity, and peak performance, so seeing a battery on the Note 8 that was smaller than other Galaxy devices felt  weird. This year, I\u2019m hoping for something closer to the 4,000 mAh. </p>",
            "<p>But aside from components choices and a gimmick here or there, Samsung has an even more important question to answer regarding its upcoming phablet: How do you make the Note 9 more than just a Galaxy S9+ with a stylus? </p>",
            "<p>Last year, the Note 8 debuted Samsung\u2019s first dual rear cameras, which was certainly a welcome addition, but not really a game changer considering Apple, Huawei, and others had already implemented similar setups on earlier devices. My concern is that phones with styluses could soon be thought of similarly to <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-blackberry-key2-makes-me-wish-physical-keyboards-we-1827156967\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-blackberry-key2-makes-me-wish-physical-keyboards-we-1827156967', {metric25:1})\">phones with physical keyboards</a>, a nice feature for some, but one that\u2019s declining in popularity. </p>",
            "<p>On top of that, this could be the last Note phone released before Samsung\u2019s <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-flexible-flip-phone-might-be-coming-next-year-1805252364\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-flexible-flip-phone-might-be-coming-next-year-1805252364', {metric25:1})\">long-awaited bendable screen phone goes on sale in 2019</a>.

The Beyond 0 and 1 will both have a 5.8-inch display, while the Beyond 2 will have a 6.2-inch display, ETNews reports.

            "<p>The other tidbit of info we can glean from evleaks\u2019 tweet is a sample of the Note 9's new colors, which looks to include standard black, a new, darker shade of blue, and brown. Interestingly, it seems the blue model will be the version that comes with the bright yellow S Pen Samsung showed in its original announcement, instead of having the entire phone sport that bold yellow hue. These changes have also been spotted in a shot posted by another noted leaker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1017315956131971072\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1017315956131971072', {metric25:1})\">Ice Universe</a>, which in addition to showing off that yellow and blue color combo, also seems to confirm that Samsung hasn\u2019t killed the Note 9's headphone jack either.</p>",
            "<p>Now I have to remind you that it\u2019s possible these rumors aren\u2019t entirely accurate, but based on evleaks and Ice Universe\u2019s solid track record for previous Samsung phones and Samsung\u2019s pattern of only revamping the Note\u2019s design every other year, the plausibility of these leaks being accurate is pretty high.</p>",

It\u2019s a sensible move that\u2019s  on trend and  also provides a quick and easy solution for people who a simple way to unlock the device without needing to use their fingers. </p>",
            "<p>Meanwhile, over in iPad land, Apple looks like it\u2019s going to do something similar  by <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/is-apple-brave-enough-to-make-an-ipad-with-face-id-1827315140#_ga=2.224737117.635164632.1530533677-1409107817.1528475388\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/is-apple-brave-enough-to-make-an-ipad-with-face-id-1827315140#_ga=2.224737117.635164632.1530533677-1409107817.1528475388', {metric25:1})\">ditching TouchID in favor of 3D scanning FaceID sensors</a> on the next version of the iPad Pro. But if we\u2019re being honest, neither move is all that unexpected, and they aren\u2019t very exciting either. </p>",
            "<p>So now I\u2019m left wondering what could Samsung possibly do to inject a little thrill back into Galaxy Tab line? Or to be more precise, long after the tablet boom has come and gone, is it even possible for people to feel anything more than mild satisfaction when it comes to the release of new flagship tablets?</p>",
            "<p>In fact, the Tab S4's stiffest competition may actually come from Samsung itself. That\u2019s because earlier this year, Samsung released the <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-chromebook-plus-v2-do-more-from-anywhere/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-chromebook-plus-v2-do-more-from-anywhere/', {metric25:1})\">Chromebook Plus V2</a>, which like the Tab S3, comes with a built-in stylus in addition to a sizable 12.2-inch display, multiple USB-C ports, and Chrome OS, which is a better operating system for actually getting work done than standard Android. </p>",
            "<p>And for all that, the Chromebook Plus V2 sports a price tag of just $500, $100 less than what the Tab S3 cost when it was released last year (and that\u2019s before you factor in the additional $130 you need to fork over for the Tab S3's not-so-optional folding keyboard).</p>",
            "<p>So even if Samsung adds other neat features like an in-display fingerprint reader or support for Samsung\u2019s Dex dock that would let the Tab S4 transform into a desktop (<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/your-samsung-galaxy-phone-may-power-two-screens-at-once-with-dex-dock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.cnet.com/news/your-samsung-galaxy-phone-may-power-two-screens-at-once-with-dex-dock/', {metric25:1})\">while also possibly functioning as a second monitor</a>), I\u2019m just not sure a $700 or more premium tablet running Android (or iOS for that matter) makes any sense.</p>",
            "<p>I would love to be wrong, and it\u2019s definitely possible Samsung has even more wild tricks in mind for the Galaxy Tab S4. But tablets haven\u2019t really been exciting for a number of years, and right now, it\u2019s hard to imagine a feature that would make more than a handful of people care about a high-priced tablet in 2018.</p>"

            "<p>When a delayed launch left an S8-sized hole at Mobile World Congress last year, the start to the spring smartphone season felt a little so-so. Samsung wasn\u2019t going to make the same mistake again, so here it is, the new Galaxy S9 and S9+.<br></p>",
            "<p>At first glance, the S9\u2019s appearance might suggest that not a lot has changed. After all, while Samsung says the S9\u2019s display is a bit brighter and its bezels are a little slimmer, you\u2019re still getting the same extra-widescreen 18:9 AMOLED Infinity display we saw on last year\u2019s model. Even its dimensions are largely unchanged, with the S9 sporting a 5.8-inch screen, while the S9+ is staying pat at 6.2-inches.</p>",
            "<p>Sure, in back, things look slightly different now that Samsung has moved the fingerprint sensor below the camera, instead of putting it off to the right like it did before. And while the S9+\u2019s new dual rear cam system with a 2x zoom is nice, we saw Samsung do that on the Galaxy Note 8 back in the fall. So as far as the S9's exterior goes, that\u2019s it for changes. I\u2019m not gonna lie, I was hoping for more, but since the S8 was already an exceedingly pretty device, it\u2019s hard to be too disappointed.<br></p>",
            "<p>But what\u2019s really exciting are all the changes going on inside. Now before we continue, please forgive me for getting extra technical, but I can\u2019t help i!. That\u2019s because aside from the S9's new stereo speakers (which are a first for a Galaxy Phone), many of Samsung\u2019s new advancement involve some sophisticated details about the S9 and its world-first dual aperture camera. </p>",
            "<p>The aperture is literally the hole through which the light travels to the camera sensor. The lower the number the bigger the hole and the more light that\u2019s allowed in. The idea is that by letting the camera switch between f/2.4 and f/1.5 (the widest aperture available on smartphone so far), the S9 should produce even better photos in both bright light and super dark conditions. And when you combine that with a new 12-MP super speed dual pixel sensor, Samsung says the S9 can capture nearly 60 percent more light than before. Samsung has even improved the S9\u2019s multi-frame image processing, which now smashes together three sets of four photos shot back-to-back into one image, with more details and less noise that one would theoretically get from a single pic. <br></p>",
            "<p>That\u2019s not the only new trick the S9\u2019s camera is sporting either. Using a new image sensor with dedicated on-board memory, the S9 can now shoot slow-mo videos at up to an eye-popping 960 fps in 0.2 second bursts. And don\u2019t worry about missing the moment with just a fifth of a second to work with, because Samsung\u2019s slow-mo can automatically detect action and trigger the camera to ensure you nail the shot. How well that feature actually works outside of the cool demo remains to be seen.</p>",
            "<p>Bixby is also taking advantage of the S9\u2019s camera upgrades with a number of new additions to its sight-based Vision skills. Now, the S9 can do things like look at a piece of food and give you an estimate of how many calories it has, or let you try on different types of makeup from Sephora by pointing the selfie cam at your face and choosing a color. </p>",
            "<p>But perhaps the slickest new Bixby feature is its on-the-fly translation skills. Instead of entering characters into an app or taking a pic of a sign, all you have to do its point the S9's camera at some foreign words and it will technomagically  replace the stuff you don\u2019t understand with a language you do. </p>",
            "<p>And as you would expect, the S9 is no slouch in the specs department either. It\u2019s got Qualcomm\u2019s new chip, the Snapdragon 845, along with 4GB of RAM (or 6GB on the S9+), 64GB of storage and a good \u2018ole microSD slot. And unlike Motorola, HTC, Google and Apple, which have all axed the headphone jack on their latest flagships, the S9 has retained its handy 3.5mm jack. </p>",
            "<p>Now comes the silly stuff. After Apple launched Animoji on the iPhone X last fall, you knew it wouldn\u2019t be long until Samsung put out its take too. But instead of just using your face to animate a fuzzy bunny (which the S9 can totally do too), Samsung has gone full Bitmoji with its new AR Emoji feature. </p>",
            "<p>All you have to do is snap a selfie, and in a few seconds, your pic is transformed into a cartoony digital avatar, complete with the ability to change you skin color, hair, eye wear and even your you outfit. Then you can save them to the gallery and send them anywhere you like on social media. </p>",
            "<p>AR Emoji also respond to your face, so if you want to use them to send a wink or grin over the internet, you can do that too. That said, I think the best part about AR Emoji is the ability to put googley eyes on everything. It\u2019s kinda janky, kinda gimmicky and only a little fun, but I guess in a post-Emoji Movie world, this is the society we\u2019re living in. </p>",
            "<p>Goddamn, that\u2019s about everything, and I didn\u2019t even get to talk about the revamped Dex Pad or the S9's new Intelligent Scan security, which mimics Apple\u2019s FaceID by combining the phone\u2019s iris sensor and face scanner into a single unlock system (that\u2019s another feature we\u2019re waiting for more details on). But with all this, it\u2019s clear the S9 represents the absolute best tech Samsung can cram in a phone, and from my short time with it so far, the S9 looks like a full-weighted retort to Apple\u2019s iPhone X.</p>",
            "<p>Samsung has not announced official pricing yet, but thankfully the company did say prices should be comparable to the S8 at launch. The S9 will in three colors: lilac purple, coral blue and black, with pre-orders going live on March 2nd, before phones ship two weeks later on March 16th. </p>",
            "<p><strong>Update: (12:45pm EST)</strong> AT&amp;T has announced pricing. The S9 will retail for $790.20 and the S9+ will have a full retail price of $915.</p>"

            "<p>While I didn\u2019t encounter these issues on our <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944', {metric25:1})\">S9+ review unit</a>, based on feedback in these threads, it seems these touchscreen deadspots are affecting both the standard Galaxy S9 and the pricier S9+, with slightly more users reporting the issue on the larger 6.2-inch model. </p>",
            "<p>A couple GIFs captured by Reddit user <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS9/comments/85kkpq/s9_general_discussion_thread_19418/dw1cfq8/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS9/comments/85kkpq/s9_general_discussion_thread_19418/dw1cfq8/', {metric25:1})\">/u/bobdurfob</a> do a good job of illustrating the problem. In the example on the left, after turning on a feature that highlights touch input, you can see that when dragging a finger across the screen, the phone suddenly suddenly stops recognizing anything about two-thirds of the way down. </p>",

However, depending on the phone, it seems these deadspots aren\u2019t always in the same place, which can make the issue a bit harder to detect. </p>",
            "<p>The  prevailing theory for these deadspots is that they are caused by a faulty digitizer, which is the component on a phone responsible for detecting touch inputs. Currently, it\u2019s difficult to tell how widespread the issue is, or how many devices may be affected. We have  reached out to Samsung for more info and an official statement, and we\u2019ll update when we hear back.</p>",
            "<p>While it\u2019s essentially impossible for 100 percent of devices coming out a factory to be free of defects, an issue like this can have a serious impact on the overall usability of the device.

        "author": "Sam Rutherford",
        "text": [
            "<p>Let\u2019s not beat around the bush, the exterior of the Samsung Galaxy S9 is essentially a carbon copy of <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-the-prettiest-phone-wins-1794526975\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-the-prettiest-phone-wins-1794526975', {metric25:1})\">the S8</a>. Yet, even with all that sameness, Samsung\u2019s balanced no-notch design seems more considered than before. It doesn\u2019t feel needy like a lot of the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/after-just-6-months-the-phone-notch-is-already-deeply-1823469447#_ga=2.179464684.998350853.1520430766-71065371.1519311125\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/after-just-6-months-the-phone-notch-is-already-deeply-1823469447#_ga=2.179464684.998350853.1520430766-71065371.1519311125', {metric25:1})\">new iPhone X copycat handsets</a> I saw at MWC. And what makes the S9 even better is that Samsung\u2019s flagship comes with  the best guts you can get in an Android phone right now. I can\u2019t help it, I\u2019m a little bit in love.</p>",
            "<p>So let\u2019s start with the easy stuff. The S9's screen is simply the best in the business. Not only has peak brightness improved to 605 nits (that\u2019s more than 10 percent brighter than the 540 nits I got from the Note 8's display), colors are vibrant, images are sharp, and when it comes to other phones, I just don\u2019t really want to look at them anymore. The only thing that really comes close is the display on the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/i-hate-how-much-i-love-the-iphone-x-1820086867\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/i-hate-how-much-i-love-the-iphone-x-1820086867', {metric25:1})\">iPhone X</a>, which as it happens, is also made by Samsung. </p>",
            "<p>Then there\u2019s the S9's new stereo speakers, which are the first ones Samsung has put on any Galaxy phone. Like other handsets, it splits audio between the bottom-firing speaker and the earpiece. The latter functions a bit like a tweeter, offering up richer highs while helping balance out the mids, so that the bottom speakers can focus more on pushing out a not insignificant amount of bass. This means these speakers, while still not comparable to headphones or standalone speakers, actually sound pretty good.<br></p>",
            "<p>On the inside, as the first phone sporting Qualcomm\u2019s new Snapdragon 845 processor, the S9 is setting a new standard for what great performance Android should be. Everything just feels snappier, from launching apps to flipping through different pages on the home screen, to the point where I was wondering if Samsung did some sneaky stuff like speed up the S9's UI animations. But after seeing the benchmark numbers posted by the S9+, it\u2019s clear there wasn\u2019t really a need.</p>",
            "<p>Across both compute and graphics tests, the S9 performed 25 percent better than last year\u2019s top marks. On Geekbench 4, the S9+ hit 8,414, versus the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-10-pro-is-a-valiant-attempt-to-slay-the-ip-1820480251\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-10-pro-is-a-valiant-attempt-to-slay-the-ip-1820480251', {metric25:1})\">Huawei Mate 10 Pro</a>\u2019s score of 6,766 or the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-oneplus-5t-is-very-a-damn-good-phone-for-a-reasonab-1820596179\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/the-oneplus-5t-is-very-a-damn-good-phone-for-a-reasonab-1820596179', {metric25:1})\">OnePlus 5T</a>\u2019s score of 6,752. Meanwhile, on 3DMark\u2019s Slingshot Unlimited graphics test, the S9 scored 6,497, compared to 5,143 for the OP5T. And if you\u2019re like me who often finds themselves living and working off your phone, the speed at which the S9 switches between even the most cumbersome of apps is downright delightful. </p>",
            "<p>The S9+\u2019s new chip has also had a serious impact on battery life too. Despite having a 3,500 mAh battery which is the same size as the power pack in last year\u2019s S8+, the S9+ lasted more than an hour and a half longer en route to an impressive time of 12 hours and 27 minutes on our rundown test. Going strictly by the numbers, that\u2019s better than every phone I reviewed last year, aside from the Asus Zenfone 4 Max\u2019s time of 16:13. But that phone\u2019s only talent is its ridiculous longevity.</p>",
            "<p>The S9 actually has lots of other nice traits besides long battery life. Like Intelligent Scan. It\u2019s Samsung\u2019s response to Apple\u2019s FaceID on the iPhone X. It\u2019s also clever, if not really all that new. Basically, Samsung took the face unlock and iris recognition tech from last year\u2019s S8, which could be used independently but not at the same time, and made it so that both functions worked together on the new S9. </p>",
            "<p>Now, if for whatever reason face unlock doesn\u2019t work, the S9 then automatically gives your irises a go, before letting you into your phone. Over the better part of a week and half, I never had any real troubles with it, though it still isn\u2019t quite as smooth as the iPhone X\u2019s implementation and its sophisticated IR projector. It\u2019s more likely to be spoofed with a mask or really high quality photo and the fact that Samsung itself won\u2019t let you use Intelligent Scan with Samsung Pay or it\u2019s Secure Folder says something about much it trusts the feature. To me, it\u2019s a bonus, but not anything to brag about. </p>",
            "<p>Now onto that S9's new rear camera. For 2018, Samsung is trying to beat the rest by putting the first-ever adjustable aperture camera on a smartphone. Technically, it\u2019s really a neat feat, letting the camera switch between a super wide f/1.5 for when you really need every last bit of light, and f/2.4 which lets you stop down and better control how many photons are hitting the camera\u2019s sensor in bright daytime shots. However, unless you\u2019re someone who is constantly fiddling with manual camera settings in pro-mode, the differences between the two apertures are hard to discern.</p>",
            "<p>In the right conditions and when the subject isn\u2019t too far away, sometimes you can notice a difference in depth of field, which is the distance between the nearest and farthest things that appears to be in focus. But in auto mode, the S9 will just choose the whatever setting works best, and it\u2019s almost always right. So most people won\u2019t notice when the camera\u2019s aperture changes.</p>",
            "<p>That said, don\u2019t assume the S9's camera has failed to improve. It\u2019s better. In well-lit scenes, the S9 can totally hang with the Pixel 2, even with Google\u2019s often praised extra-special HDR processing. When I took a sample shot of lower Manhattan using both phones (see above), the biggest difference between the two  pictures was how the movement changed between the two sets of pics. The photos were essentially the same. </p>",
            "<p>So then I went back at night and took the exact same shot. That\u2019s when the S9+ pulled ahead. With both handsets on auto (including HDR), Samsung\u2019s version was clearly the winner. Say what you want about the powers of computational photography, that tech has it\u2019s limits, and there\u2019s still no substitute for high quality optics. </p>",
            "<p>With a f/1.8 aperture, the Pixel 2 XL just wasn\u2019t able to pull in as much light, which resulted in a noticeably grainier and softer shot than what the S9+ produced. In fact, I was so shocked that after getting home and checking out both pics on my desktop monitor, I set up another head-to-head photo test to make sure everything was set up correctly.<br></p>",
            "<p>And in this intentionally poorly-lit face-off, the S9+ impressed even more. Between the Pixel 2 XL and the S9+, their shots look wildly different. Samsung\u2019s new camera is a goddamn low-light champ.<br></p>",
            "<p>Later, I went back to shooting more traditional pics, and I do have to say that the Pixel 2 does have a slight edge in color saturation over the S9, but the difference isn\u2019t anywhere close to the phones\u2019 low-light discrepancies. The takeaway? Starting now, if I have to choose one phone to shoot something, the S9 is my pick. <br></p>",
            "<p>Additionally, the larger version of Samsung\u2019s new flagship (the S9+) also sports a secondary 12-megapixel camera with a 2x zoom that we first saw on the Galaxy Note 8. It\u2019s not a must have feature, but being able to push in just a bit closer makes me feel a little more OK when I decide to leave my real camera at home. </p>",
            "<p class=\"has-video media-large video-embed align--bleed\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" scrolling=\"no\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" data-src=\"/ajax/inset/iframe?id=mcp-3539550&amp;sponsored=false&amp;post_id=1823575944&amp;platform=web&amp;postPosition=0&amp;cloudinaryImageOverride=fpcbcu8qmktoudjoxyy3&amp;cloudinaryImageOverrideFormat=JPG\" data-recommend-id=\"mcp://3539550\" height=\"450\" id=\"mcp-3539550\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitAllowFullScreen\" class=\"core-inset lazyload\" width=\"800\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span></p>",
            "<p>The S9 can shoot slow-mo at up to 960 fps now too. For a short time, this feature had me trying to turn every little thing into a time-slowed video, and when it works, it\u2019s pretty fun. You just have to know the limits, because 960 fps is basically the same as shooting with a shutter speed of 1/960th of a second, which means only well-lit stuff ends up looking good.</p>",
            "<p>Even Bixby, Samsung\u2019s digital Assistant, which yes, still has its own button on the left, has gotten in one some of that sweet, sweet camera action. Now you can use it to try on makeup, or guesstimate how many calories are in a piece of food. And to my surprise, both of these features are good enough to give you a decent idea of what you\u2019re working with. I just wouldn\u2019t call them scientific. </p>",
            "<p>Yet for me, the best of these enhancements is Bixby\u2019s translation feature, which lets you point the camera at foreign words before the S9 overlays understandable text on top without much of a wait. It\u2019s not perfect, but it did help me make a more informed lunch purchase while stuck in the Barcelona airport.</p>",
            "<p>Only the S9 isn\u2019t all speed and incredible battery life and camera performance. We need to talk about the one area where Samsung is obviously chasing the pack: AR Emojis. By using the S9's front camera, you can create little avatars based on your face that you can dress up, change their hair, or create shareable gifs that capture your reactions. But it\u2019s just a gimmick. They kind of look like Nintendo Miis in a cartoony sort of way, and the clothing choices are super limited and dorky looking.</p>",
            "<p>For anyone wondering if AR Emoji\u2019s better than Animoji\u2019s? I don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t really care, they are just different. Trying to decide between phones based solely on their ability to perform AR trickery is absurd.</p>",
            "<p>AR Emojis aside, this phone sounds great! But is the S9 worth upgrading to? If you\u2019ve been using the same phone for two years or more, definitely. However for people who own an S8, the decision isn\u2019t quite as clear. For the past year, I\u2019ve spent most of my smartphone time spent switching between a regular S8 and a Pixel 2 XL. And as much as I like the S9's improvements, spending $720 or more after just 12 months is hard to justify (though I maintain the same could be said of almost anyone thinking about a one-year upgrade). You\u2019ve got to really want it.<br></p>",
            "<p>And if you really want it the S9  has the most tricks in its bag. You get almost all of the nifty features Google includes in Android, along with optional dual cams, a smarter, more helpful iteration of Bixby, and a new generation of silicon that makes the phone feel snappy as fuck. There\u2019s a lot of things I like about the Pixel 2 XL, but after spending prolonged time with the Galaxy S9+, I\u2019m really struggling to find any major reasons to go back to it. I don\u2019t particularly care that Intelligent Scan isn\u2019t as secure as FaceID, and I admit that AR Emojis kind of suck too. However, the S9+\u2019s superb battery life, class-leading low-light photography and  the best display ever made easily cancel that stuff out. It\u2019s clear, Samsung is back out in front.</p>",
