    "We'll implement two version of a supplement, one that's new and one that's already used, in two different groups of nutrition stores. The two groups of stores will be divided randomly by location and will represent our samples. To all the customers who bought the sleep supplement, we'd ask them to fill out a short survey via email to rate how well they slept given a certain range where 1 is not at all and 5 is like a baby. Then we'd compare the results of the surveys between the two groups. We also collect information on the survey for age, gender and whether they have any medical condition that inhibits their sleep, so that we can compare the results on constant variables and make sure any difference is attributed to the supplement."

Our hypothesis would be that new uniforms won't help a gym's business. Then, over the course of three months, we'll measure their average revenues and compare them. Other variables we would need to measure are whether the gyms are in urban or rural areas as well as the season that the study takes place so that we can make sure our consumer base is consistent."

For example we can implement the new homepage in specific regions that are randomly selected, and keep the current homepage for another group of regions. Our hypothesis would be that a new homepage would increase revenue for the pet rental business. So we would measure the average revenue of the two samples and compare them. We would specify the control variables as urban or rural areas, age and gender so that we can measure based on similar traits."

Our constant variables would be the type of recipients of the email, such as whether they're coworkers, friends, or family, and at what time the emails were sent, such as in the evening or in the morning."
