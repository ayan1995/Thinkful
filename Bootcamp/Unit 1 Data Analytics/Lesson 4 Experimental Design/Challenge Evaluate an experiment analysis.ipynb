    "***1. The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, \"Give In to Your Anger,\" isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, \"Together We Can Rule the Galaxy.\" They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the \"Anger\" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the \"Together\" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that \"Anger\" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.***\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't know if the droids are recruited because of the slogan or because of the person presenting the slogan since Palpatine presents one and Vader presents the other. The same person should give both slogans to both groups. Also, the sample size of 50 droids per group is probably not representative enough for the whole galaxy. Perhaps multilpe trials will give a more accurate result. For example, the sith captured at least 3 more sets of 100 droids that are split into groups and the same test is given, then we can make better conclusions."

    "***2. In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.***\n",
    "\n",
    "Jar Jar and Windu are compared on uneven terms. Windu went to four unfriendly planets so his audience was more difficult than that of Jar Jar who went to four friendly planets. They should divide the planets so that each of them go to two friendly planets and two unfriendly planets and then measure their effectiveness."

You calculate average job satisfaction for HR and for IT and present the report.***\n",

When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to \"opt in\" to a data collection scheme where their level of physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.***\n",

She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A, then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.***\n",
