You have data on individual visitors' sessions (activity on a website, pageviews, and purchases), as well as whether or not those users converted from an advertisement for that session. You also have the cost and price information for the goods.\n",

Whichever good returns the highest revenue should be featured on the new advertising campaign."

The onboarding funnel has three steps: email and password signup, plan choice, and payment. On a user level you have information on what steps they have completed as well as timestamps for all of those events for the past 3 years. You also have information on marketing spend on a weekly level.\n",

    "We would analyze the trend of the number of people who have signed up via email and password over the last 3 years and compare that trend to market spending the market spending trend over the last 3 years. Then we would compare trend for the proportion of those who've signed up that actually chose a plan with the trend for the proportion of those who made a payment to see where the most people were discouraged."

    "**Which users have stopped logging in or decreased how often and how long they've logged in for?** We could group those users who have stopped logging in by filtering those who havent logged in for the last 6 months and also create another group who have used the product significantly less in the last 6 months compared to before by comparing their length session. Then we can analyze what separates this group from those who continue to use the product."
